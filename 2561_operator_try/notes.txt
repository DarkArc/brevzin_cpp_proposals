* Thomas Koppe points out further macros in tensorflow and google along these lines.
* Kirk points out how error is really the wrong name for this
* Michael points out pattern matching, and how the ? e pattern could use this also (further questioning calling it error propagation)

* maybe allow member struct try_traits { };
* can define E1 ?? E2 and E1 ?. E2 in terms of this 
* should rebind be a type or a traits instantiation?
