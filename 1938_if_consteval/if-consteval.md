# Revision history

R2 to R3: Wording changes.

R1 to R2: R1 [@P1938R1] of this paper originally mandated the use of braces in `if consteval` (see [why braces](#why-braces), also new in this revision) grammatically. Davis Herring pointed out in an EWG telecon that this causes some issues:

```cpp
if (cond)
    if consteval { s0; }
    else s1;
```

If the grammar for `if consteval` has _compound-statement_, then the `else` here _cannot_ be associated with the `if consteval`, it must be associated with the outer `if`. Rather than that, we want this to a compile error due to the lack of braces around `s1`.

R0 to R1: R0 [@P1938R0] of this paper initially contained only a positive form: `if consteval`. This paper additionally adds a negated form, `if not consteval`.

# Introduction

Despite this paper missing both our respective NB comment deadlines and the mailing
deadline, we still believe it provides a significant enough improvement
to the status quo that it should be considered for C++20.

C++20 will have several new features to aid programmers in writing code during
constant evaluation. Two of these are `std::is_constant_evaluated()` [@P0595R2]
and `consteval` [@P1073R3], both adopted in San Diego 2018. `consteval` is for
functions that can only be invoked during constant evaluation.
`is_constant_evaluated()` is a magic library function to check if the current
evaluation is constant evaluation to provide, for instance, a valid implementation
of an algorithm for constant evaluation time and a better implementation for runtime.

However, despite being adopted at the same meeting, these features interact poorly with
each other and have other issues that make them ripe for confusion.

# Problems with Status Quo

There are two problems this paper wishes to address.

## Interaction between `constexpr` and `consteval`

The first problem is the interplay between this magic library function and the
new `consteval`. Consider the example:

```cpp
consteval int f(int i) { return i; }

constexpr int g(int i) {
    if (std::is_constant_evaluated()) {
        return f(i) + 1; // <==
    } else {
        return 42;
    }
}

consteval int h(int i) {
    return f(i) + 1;
}
```

The function `h` here is basically a lifted, constant-evaluation-only version
of the function `g`. At constant evaluation time, they do the same thing,
except that during runtime, you cannot call `h`, and `g` has this extra path.
Maybe this code started with just `h` and someone decided a runtime version
would also be useful and turned it into `g`.

Unfortunately, `h` is well-formed while `g` is ill-formed. You cannot make that
call to `f` (that is ominously marked with an arrow) in that location. Even
though that call will *only* happen during constant evaluation, that's
still not enough.

With specific terms, the call to `f()` inside of `g()` is an
_immediate invocation_ and needs to be a constant expression and it is not.
Whereas the call to `f()` inside of `h()` is *not* considered an _immediate invocation_
because it is in an _immediate function context_ (i.e. it's invoked from another immediate
function), so it has a weaker set of restrictions that it needs to follow.

In other words, this kind of construction of conditionally invoking a
`consteval` function from a `constexpr` function just Does Not Work (modulo
the really trivial cases - one could call `f(42)` for instance, just never
`f(i)`).

We find this lack of composability of features to be problematic and think it
can be improved.

## The `if constexpr (std::is_constant_evaluated())` problem

The second problem is specific to `is_constant_evaluated`. Once you learn what this
magic function is for, the obvious usage of it is:

```cpp
constexpr size_t strlen(char const* s) {
    if constexpr (std::is_constant_evaluated()) {
        for (const char *p = s; ; ++p) {
            if (*p == '\0') {
                return static_cast<std::size_t>(p - s);
            }
        }
    } else {
        __asm__("SSE 4.2 insanity");
    }
}
```

This example, inspired by [@P1045R0], has a bug: it uses `if constexpr`
to check the conditional `is_constant_evaluated()` rather than a simple `if`.
You have to really deeply understand a lot about how constant evaluation works
in C++ to understand that this is in fact not only _not_ "obviously correct" but
is in fact "obviously incorrect," for some definition of obvious. This is such
a likely source of error that Barry submitted bugs to both [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=91428)
and [clang](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42977) to encourage the
compilers to warn on such improper usage. gcc 10.1 will provide a warning
for the [simple case](https://godbolt.org/z/LiiZoW):

```
<source>: In function 'constexpr int f(int)':
<source>:4:45: warning: 'std::is_constant_evaluated' always evaluates to true in 'if constexpr' [-Wtautological-compare]
    4 |     if constexpr (std::is_constant_evaluated()) {
      |                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~
```

But then people have to understand why this is a warning, and what this even
means. Nevertheless, a compiler warning is substantially better than silently
wrong code, but it is problematic to have an API in which many users are drawn
to a usage that is tautologically incorrect.

### Compiler warnings

When R0 of this paper was presented in Belfast, the implementers assured that
all the compilers would properly warn on all tautological uses of
`std::is_constant_evaluated()` - both in the always-`true` and always-`false`
cases.

As of this writing, for instance, EDG warns on all of the following:

```cpp
constexpr int f1() {
  if constexpr (!std::is_constant_evaluated() && sizeof(int) == 4) { // warning: always true
    return 0;
  }
  if (std::is_constant_evaluated()) {
    return 42;
  } else {
    if constexpr (std::is_constant_evaluated()) { // warning: always true
      return 0;
    }
  }
  return 7;
}


consteval int f2() {
  if (std::is_constant_evaluated() && f1()) { // warning: always true
    return 42;
  }
  return 7;
}


int f3() {
  if (std::is_constant_evaluated() && f1()) { // warning: always false
    return 42;
  }
  return 7;
}
```

We expect the other compilers to follow suit.

# Proposal

We propose a new form of `if` statement which is spelled:

```cpp
if consteval { }
```

The braces (in both the `if` and the optional `else`) are mandatory and there
is no condition. If evaluation of this
statement occurs during constant evaluation, the first substatement is executed.
Otherwise, the second substatement (if there is one) is executed.

This behaves exactly as today's:

```cpp
if (std::is_constant_evaluated()) { }
```

except with three differences:

1. No header include is necessary.
2. The syntax is different, which completely sidesteps the confusion over the
proper way to check if we're in constant evaluation. You simply cannot misuse
the syntax.
3. We can use `if consteval` to allow invoking immediate functions.

To explain the last point a bit more, the current language rules allow you to invoke
a `consteval` function from inside of another `consteval` function
([\[expr.const\]/13](http://eel.is/c++draft/expr.const#13)) - we can do this by
construction:

::: bq
An expression or conversion is in an _immediate function context_ if it is
potentially evaluated and its innermost non-block scope is a function parameter
scope of an immediate function. An expression or conversion is an
_immediate invocation_ if it is an explicit or implicit invocation of an
immediate function and is not in an immediate function context.
An immediate invocation shall be a constant expression.
:::


By extending the term _immediate function context_ to also include
an `if consteval` block, we can allow the second example to work:

```cpp
consteval int f(int i) { return i; }

constexpr int g(int i) {
    if consteval {
        return f(i) + 1; // ok: immediate function context
    } else {
        return 42;
    }
}

consteval int h(int i) {
    return f(i) + 1; // ok: immediate function context
}
```

Additionally, such a feature would allow for an easy implementation of the
original `std::is_constant_evaluated()`:

```cpp
constexpr bool is_constant_evaluated() {
    if consteval {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

Although this paper does not suggest removing the library function.

## Negated form

Many people have expressed the view that a negated form is also useful. That form is also proposed here, spelled:

```cpp
if not consteval { }
```
or
```cpp
if ! consteval { }
```

With the semantics that the first substatement is executed if the context is _not_ manifestly constant evaluated, otherwise the second substatement (if any) is executed.

## Conditioned Form

As proposed, this new form of `if` does not have a condition - unlike the other
two we already have. While there are certainly cases where an added condition
would be useful, this paper is deliberately not including such a thing. The vast
majority of uses are expected to be just of the `if consteval` or `if not consteval`
form and we do not want to clutter future design space in this area.

There are currently two uses in libstdc++ that are of the form
`if (is_constant_evaluated() && cond)`. [One example](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/abe13e1847fb91d43f02b5579c4230214d4369f4/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/range_access.h#L1025-L1028):

```cpp
if (std::is_constant_evaluated() && __n < 0)
  throw "attempt to decrement a non-bidirectional iterator";
```

This usage is perfectly fine and doesn't necessary need special support from
this proposal. Or it could also be written as:

```cpp
if consteval {
  if (__n < 0) throw "attempt to decrement a non-bidirectional iterator";
}
```

Or factored into a function like:

```cpp
if consteval {
  consteval_assert(__n >= 0,
    "attempt to decrement a non-bidirectional iterator");
}
```

Either way, the condition form doesn't feel strongly motivated except for
consistency with `if` and `if constexpr`.

## Deprecating `std::is_constant_evaluated()`

One of the questions that comes up regularly in discussing this paper is: if
we had `if consteval`, we do we even need `std::is_constant_evaluated()`, and
can we just deprecate it?

This paper proposes no such deprecation. The reason is that this function is
actually still occasionally useful (as in the previous section).
If the standard library does not provide it,
users will write their own. We're not concerned about the implementation difficulty
of it - the users that need this will definitely be able to write it correctly -
but we are concerned with a proliferation of exactly this function. The advantage
of having the one `std::is_constant_evaluated()` is both that it becomes actually
teachable and also that it becomes warnable: the warnings discussed can happen
only because we know what this name means. Maybe it's still possible to warn
on `if constexpr (your::is_constant_evaluated())` but that's a much harder
problem.

And note that libstdc++ already has [some](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/abe13e1847fb91d43f02b5579c4230214d4369f4/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/char_traits.h#L236)
[uses](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/abe13e1847fb91d43f02b5579c4230214d4369f4/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/char_traits.h#L260)
that do require the function form.

## Why braces?

The braces in an `if consteval` statement are mandatory:

```cpp
if consteval {
   f(i); // ok
}

if consteval f(i); // ill-formed
```

There is no technical reason to mandate braces. Our reason for them is to emphasize visually that we're dropping into an entirely different context. In this sense, it's similar to `try` and `catch` mandating braces. It's also quite unlike `if constexpr` in that the language rules in the taken statement actually change, so we think it merits the different rules.

Without braces, we have no separation between the `if consteval` introducer and the statement being executed. This becomes especially important if the statement being executed itself includes some sort of keyword:

```cpp
if consteval for (; it != end; ++it) ;
if consteval if (it != end);
```

A normal `if` statement has a parenthesized condition, which functions as such a separator, and we think such visual separation is important:

```cpp
if (cond) f(i);
```

An alternate syntax suggested was `if (consteval)`, with no requirement on braces, to look more like a regular `if` statement. But this syntax suggests that other forms might be valid, which we either cannot support due to the implementation heroics necessary to so:

```cpp
if (consteval && n < 0) {
  // We would need to take an arbitrary boolean condition, C, and
  // be able to prove that (not is_constant_evaluated) implies (not C).
  // That's an arbitrarily complex problem.
  some_consteval_fun(n);
}
```

Or suggests that other forms might be valid that make little sense to even want to support:

```cpp
while (consteval) { /* ... */ }
switch (consteval) { /* ... */ }
```

Overall, we think the fact that `if consteval` looks different from a regular `if` statement is arguably a benefit.

This question of syntax was discussed on the October 8th EWG telecon [@github.p1938], where the following polls were taken (note that the first two polls are phrased as changes from the status quo as proposed in this paper):

::: quote
`if consteval` should be parenthesized as `if (consteval)`


SF | F | N | A | SA
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
1 | 1 | 3 | 10 | 5

`if consteval` should not require braces, making this valid: `if consteval boom(); else bam();`


SF | F | N | A | SA
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 4


`if consteval` is tentatively ready to be voted on to forward to Core, after updating the paper as discussed

SF | F | N | A | SA
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
10 | 11 | 1 | 0 | 0
:::

## Examples

Here are a few examples from libstdc++. Today, they're implemented uses a builtin
function, and how they would look with `if consteval`. It's not a big difference,
just spelling.

::: cmptable
### From libstdc++
```cpp
if (!__builtin_is_constant_evaluated())
  __glibcxx_assert( __shift_exponent != numeric_limits<_Tp>::digits );
```

### Proposed
```cpp
if not consteval {
   __glibcxx_assert( __shift_exponent != numeric_limits<_Tp>::digits );
}
```

---

```cpp
if (__builtin_is_constant_evaluated())
  return __x < __y;
return (__UINTPTR_TYPE__)__x > (__UINTPTR_TYPE__)__y;
```

```cpp
if consteval {
  return __x < __y;
} else {
  return (__UINTPTR_TYPE__)__x > (__UINTPTR_TYPE__)__y;
}
```
:::

As of this writing, libstdc++ has 23 uses that could be replaced by `if consteval`, 2 that could be replaced by `if not consteval`, and 2 that require an extra
condition on the comparison.

# History

The initial revision of the `std::is_constant_evaluated()` proposal [@P0595R0]
was actually targeted as a language feature rather than a library feature. The
original spelling was `if (constexpr())`. The paper was presented in Kona 2017
and was received very favorably in the form it was presented (17-4). The poll
to consider a magic library alternative was only marginally more preferred (17-3).
We believe that in the two years since these polls were taken, having a dedicated
language feature with an impossible-to-misuse API, that can coexist with the rest
of the constant ecosystem, is the right direction.

# Wording

Extend the definition of immediate function context in [expr.const]{.sref} (and use
bullet points):

::: bq
An expression or conversion is in an _immediate function context_ if it is
potentially evaluated and [either]{.addu}:

- [13.1]{.pnum} its innermost non-block scope is a function parameter scope of an
immediate function[.]{.rm} [, or]{.addu}
- [13.2]{.pnum} [its enclosing statement is enclosed ([stmt.pre]) by the _compound-statement_ of a
consteval if statement ([stmt.if]).]{.addu}
:::

Change [stmt.select]{.sref} to add the new grammar:

::: bq
```diff
  @_selection-statement_@:
     if constexpr@~opt~@ ( @_init-statement_@@~opt~@ @_condition_@ ) @_statement_@
     if constexpr@~opt~@ ( @_init-statement_@@~opt~@ @_condition_@ ) @_statement_@ else @_statement_@
+    if !@~opt~@ consteval @_compound-statement_@
+    if !@~opt~@ consteval @_compound-statement_@ else @_statement_@
     switch ( @_init-statement_@@~opt~@ @_condition_@ ) @_statement_@
```
:::

Add a new clause to [stmt.if]{.sref}:

::: bq
::: addu
[a]{.pnum} An `if` statement of the form `if consteval` is
called a _consteval if_ statement. The _statement_, if any, in a consteval if statement shall be a _compound-statement_. [ *Example* -
```
constexpr void f(bool b) {
  if (true)
    if consteval { }
    else ; // error: not a compound-statement
           // "else" not associated with outer if
}
```
- *end example* ]

[b]{.pnum} If a consteval if statement is evaluated in
a context that is manifestly constant-evaluated ([expr.const]), the first
substatement is executed. [*Note*: The first substatement is an immediate function context - *end note* ]
Otherwise, if the `else` part of the selection statement
is present, then the second substatement is executed.
A `case` or `default` label appearing within such an `if` statement shall be
associated with a `switch` statement within the same `if` statement.
A label declared in a substatement of a consteval if statement shall only be
referred to by a statement in the same substatement.

[c]{.pnum} An `if` statement of the form `if ! consteval @_compound-statement_@`
is not itself a consteval if statement, but is equivalent to the consteval if statement

```
if consteval { } else @_compound-statement_@
```

An `if` statement of the form `if ! consteval @_compound-statement_~1~@ else @_statement_~2~@`
is not itself a consteval if statement, but is equivalent to the consteval if statement

```
if consteval @_statement_~2~@ else @_compound-statement_~1~@
```
:::
:::

Change [meta.const.eval]{.sref} to use this new functionality:

::: bq
```
constexpr bool is_constant_evaluated() noexcept;
```
::: rm
[1]{.pnum} *Returns*: `true` if and only if evaluation of the call occurs within
the evaluation of an expression or conversion that is
manifestly constant-evaluated ([expr.const]).
:::
::: addu
[1]{.pnum} *Effects*: Equivalent to:
```
if consteval {
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
}
```
:::
:::

## Feature test macro

Add the macro `__cpp_if_consteval`.
