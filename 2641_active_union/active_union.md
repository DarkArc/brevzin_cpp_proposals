# Introduction

Let's say you want to implement an `Optional<bool>` such that `sizeof(Optional<bool>) == 1`. This is conceptually doable since `bool` only has 2 states, but takes up a whole byte anyway, which leaves 254 bit patterns to use to express other criteria (i.e. that the `Optional` is disengaged).

There are two ways to do this, neither of which have undefined behavior:

::: cmptable
### Union
```cpp
struct OptBool {
  union { bool b; char c; };

  OptBool() : c(2) { }
  OptBool(bool b) : b(b) { }

  auto has_value() const -> bool {
    return c != 2;
  }

  auto operator*() -> bool& {
    return b;
  }
};
```

### Reinterpret
```cpp
struct OptBool {
  char c;

  OptBool() : c(2) { }
  OptBool(bool b) { new (&c) bool(b); }

  auto has_value() const -> bool {
    return c != 2;
  }

  auto operator*() -> bool& {
    return (bool&)c;
  }
};
```
:::

Both of these are fine: `operator*` works because we are returning a reference to a very-much-live `bool` in both cases, and `has_value()` works because we are allowed read through a `char` (explicitly, per [\[basic.lval\]/11.3](https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4868/basic.lval#11.3) [^1]).

[^1]: All references to this paper are to [@N4868], C++20 for convenient and stable linking.

However, try to make this work in `constexpr` and we immediately run into problems.

The union solution has a problem with `has_value()` because we're not allowed to read the non-active member of a union ([\[expr.const\]/5.9](https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4868/expr.const#5.9)). `c` isn't the active member of that union, so we can't read from it, even though it's `char`.

The reinterpet solution has two problems:

* the placement new into `&c` doesn't work. Placement-new is explicitly disallowed by [\[expr.const\]/5.17](https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4868/expr.const#5.17). While we have `std::construct_at()` now to work around the lack of placement-new, that API is typed and would require a `bool*`, which we don't have.
* `operator*()` involves a `reinterpret_cast`, which is explicitly disallowed by [\[expr.const\]/5.15](https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4868/expr.const#5.15).

This is unfortunate - we have a well-defined runtime solution that we cannot use during constant evaluation time. It'd be nice to do better.

# Proposal

Supporting the reinterpret solution is expensive - since it requires the implementation to track multiple types for the same bytes. But supporting the union solution, because it's more structured (and thus arguably better anyway), is very feasible. After all, our problem is localized to `has_value()`.

During runtime, we do need to read from `c`. But during constant evaluation time, we actually don't. What we need `c` for is to know whether `b` is the active member of the union or not. But the compiler already knows whether `b` is the active member or not. Indeed, that is precisely _why_ it's rejecting this implementation. What if we could simply ask the compiler this question?

::: bq
```cpp
struct OptBool {
  union { bool b; char c; };

  constexpr OptBool() : c(2) { }
  constexpr OptBool(bool b) : b(b) { }

  constexpr auto has_value() const -> bool {
    if consteval {
      return std::is_active_union_member(&b);
    } else {
      return c != 2;
    }
  }

  constexpr auto operator*() -> bool& {
    return b;
  }
};
```
:::

There's no particular implementation burden here - the compiler already needs to know this information. No language change is necessary to support this change either.

## Implementation Experience

Daveed Vandevoorde has implemented this proposal in EDG.

# Wording

Add to [meta.type.synop]{.sref}:

::: bq
```diff
// all freestanding
namespace std {
  // ...

  // [meta.const.eval], constant evaluation context
  constexpr bool is_constant_evaluated() noexcept;
+ template<class T>
+   consteval bool is_active_union_member(T*);
}
```
:::

And add to [meta.const.eval]{.sref} (possibly this section should just change name, but it feels like these two should just go together):

::: bq
```
constexpr bool is_constant_evaluated() noexcept;
```
[1]{.pnum} *Effects*: Equivalent to:
```cpp
if consteval {
  return true;
} else {
  return false;
}
```
[2]{.pnum}
[*Example 1*:
```cpp
constexpr void f(unsigned char *p, int n) {
  if (std::is_constant_evaluated()) {           // should not be a constexpr if statement
    for (int k = 0; k<n; ++k) p[k] = 0;
  } else {
    memset(p, 0, n);                            // not a core constant expression
  }
}
```
â€” *end example*]

::: addu
```
template<class T>
  consteval bool is_active_union_member(T* p);
```

[3]{.pnum} *Returns*: `true` if `p` is a pointer to the active member of a union; otherwise, `false`.

[4]{.pnum} *Remarks*: A call to this function is not a core constant expression ([expr.const]) unless `p` is a pointer to a variant member of a union.

[5]{.pnum}
[*Example 2*:
```
struct OptBool {
  union { bool b; char c; };

  constexpr OptBool() : c(2) { }
  constexpr OptBool(bool b) : b(b) { }

  constexpr auto has_value() const -> bool {
    if consteval {
      return std::is_active_union_member(&b);
    } else {
      return c != 2;
    }
  }

  constexpr auto operator*() -> bool& {
    return b;
  }
};

constexpr OptBool disengaged;
constexpr OptBool engaged(true);
static_assert(!disengaged.has_value());
static_assert(engaged.has_value());
static_assert(*engaged);
```
