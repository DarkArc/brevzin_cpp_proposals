# Revision History

R1 [@P1858R1] was presented in EWGI in Prague [@EWGI.Prague]. An ambiguity in
pack indexing was pointed out, which is resolved here (see
[pack indexing](#pack-indexing-ambiguity)). The structured bindings simplification
was split out into its own paper, [@P2120R0], and this paper includes a new
[discussion](#one-paper-or-many) on the merits of splitting it into multiple papers.

R0 [@P1858R0] was presented in EWGI in Belfast [@EWGI.Belfast], where further
work was encouraged (9-4-1-0-0). Since then, several substantial changes have
been made to this paper.

- The overloadable `operator...()` and `using ...` were removed. 
- Pack expansion is now driven through structured bindings, which are extended
on the library side as well.
- `constexpr` ranges removed from this paper, should be handled by expansion
statements.
- Discussion of functions returning packs - no longer being proposed due to
ambiguity of what it actually could mean.
- Discussion of pack literals.

# Introduction and Motivation

C++11 introduced variadic templates, one of the truly transformational language
features introduced that standard. Despite pretty tight restrictions on where
packs could be declared and how they could be used, this feature has proven
incredibly successful. Three standards later, there hasn't even been much change.
C++17 added a couple new ways to use packs (fold expressions [@N4191] and
using-declarations [@P0195R2]), and C++20 will add a new way to introduce them
(in lambda capture [@P0780R2]). A proposal to iterate over them (expansion statements 
[@P1306R1]) didn't quite make it. That's it.

There have been many papers in the interlude about trying to enhance pack
functionality: a language typelist [@N3728], fixed size and homogeneous packs
[@N4072] (and later [@P1219R1]), indexing and slicing into packs [@N4235] and
[@P0535R0], being able to declare packs in more places [@P0341R0] and other
places [@P1061R0].

In short, there's been work in this space, although not all of these papers have
been discussed by Evolution. Although, many of these have been received favorably
and then never followed up on.

Yet the features that keep getting hinted at and requested again and again
are still missing from our feature set: 

1. the ability to declare a variable pack at class, namespace, or local scope
2. the ability to index into a pack
3. the ability to unpack a tuple, or tuple-like type, inline

All efficiently, from a compile time perspective. Instead, for (1) we have to use
`std::tuple`, for (2) we have to use `std::get`, `std::tuple_element`, or, if
we're only dealing with types, something like `mp_at_c` [@Boost.Mp11], for (3)
we have to use `std::apply()`, which necessarily introduces a new scope.
`std::apply()` is actually worse than that, since it doesn't play well with
callables that aren't objects and even worse if you want to use additional
arguments on top of that:

```cpp
std::tuple args(1, 2, 3);

// I want to call f with args... and then 4
std::apply([&](auto... vs){ return f(vs..., 4); }, args);
```

Matt Calabrese is working on a library facility to help address the shortcomings
here [@Calabrese.Argot].


This paper attempts to provide a solution to these problems, building on the work
of prior paper authors. The goal of this paper is to provide better
implementations for a library `tuple` and `variant`, ones that ends up being
much easier to
implement, more compiler friendly, and more ergonomic. The paper will piecewise
introduce the necessary language features, increasing in complexity as it goes,
and is divided into two broad sections:

- introducing the ability to declare packs in more places and to index into them
- introducing the ability to convert types to packs and to index into them

# Packs, packs, packs

This section will propose several new language features, with the motivating
example being a far simpler implementation of `tuple`, but which are generally
applicable to all uses of variadic templates in C++ today.

## Member packs

This paper proposes the ability to declare a variable pack wherever we can declare
a variable today:

```cpp
namespace xstd {
    template <typename... Ts>
    struct tuple {
        Ts... elems;
    };
}
```

That gives us all the members that we need, using a syntax that arguably has
obvious meaning to any reader familiar with C++ packs. All the usual rules
follow directly from there. That class template is an aggregate, so we can use
aggregate initialization:

```cpp
xstd::tuple<int, int, int> x{1, 2, 3};
```

Or, in C++20:

```cpp
xstd::tuple y{1, 2, 3};
```

## Empty variable pack

What does `xstd::tuple<> t;` mean here? The same way 
that an empty function parameter pack means a function taking no arguments, an
empty member variable pack means no member variables. `xstd::tuple<>` is an empty 
type. 

## Constructor and initializer packs

But `tuple` has constructors. `tuple` has _lots_ of constructors. We're not going
to go through all of them in this paper, just the interesting ones. But let's 
at least start with the easy ones:

```cpp
namespace xstd {
    template <typename... Ts>
    class tuple {
    public:
        constexpr tuple() requires (std::default_constructible<Ts> && ...)
            : elems()...
        { }
        
        constexpr tuple(Ts const&... args)
                requires (std::copy_constructible<Ts> && ...)
            : elems(args)...
        { }

    private:
        Ts... elems;
    };
}
```

Let's pick a more complex constructor. A `std::tuple<Ts...>` can be constructed
from a `std::pair<T, U>` if `sizeof...(Ts) == 2` and the two corresponding types
are convertible. How would we implement that? To do that check, we need to get
the corresponding types. How do we get the first and second types from `Ts`?

## Pack Indexing

This paper proposes a "simple selection" facility similar to the one initially
introduced in
[@N4235] (and favorably received in Urbana 2014): `T...[I]` is the `I`th element
of the pack `T`, which is a type or value or template based on what kind of pack
`T` is.
[Later sections](#disambiguating-packs)
 of this paper will discuss why this paper diverges from that
original proposal in choice of syntax.

Such indexing allows for implementing the pair converting constructor:

```cpp
namespace xstd {
    template <typename... Ts>
    class tuple {
    public:
        template <std::convertible_to<Ts...[0]> T,
                  std::convertible_to<Ts...[1]> U>
            requires sizeof...(Ts) == 2
        constexpr tuple(std::pair<T, U> const& p)
            : elems...[0](p.first)
            , elems...[1](p.second)
        { }
    private:
        Ts... elems;
    };
}
```

Notably, in an earlier example we constructed the pack as a single entity and
here we are constructing each element of the pack separately. Both are fine.
We'll see a simpler way to do this [later](#tuple-pair).

A properly constrained converting constructor from a pack:

```cpp
namespace xstd {
    template <typename... Ts>
    class tuple {
    public:
        template <std::constructible<Ts>... Us>   // everything is convertible
            requires (sizeof...(Us) > 1 ||        // exclude the copy ctor match
                    !std::derived_from<std::remove_cvref_t<Us...[0]>, tuple>)
        constexpr tuple(Us&&... us)
            : elems(std::forward<Us>(us))...
        { }
    private:
        Ts... elems;
    };
}
```


As well as implementing `tuple_element`:

```cpp
namespace std {
    template <size_t I, typename... Ts>
    struct tuple_element<I, xstd::tuple<Ts...>>
    {
        using type = Ts...[I];
    };
}
```

And a member `get`:

```cpp
namespace xstd {
    template <typename... Ts>
    class tuple {
    public:
        template <size_t I>
        auto get() const& -> Ts...[I] const& {
            return elems...[I];
        }
    
    private:
        Ts... elems;
    };
}
```

This is a lot nicer than status quo. Consider just the implementation complexity
difference between these two versions (where the status quo is taken from the
libc++ implementation). I'm including just the pieces I've shown up 'til now:
the default constructor, n-ary converting constructor, `pair` converting
constructor, and the structured bindings opt-in as a member.

When considering the differences below, don't just look at the difference
in number of lines. Consider also the difference in complexity. You almost don't
even really have to think about how to implement the "proposed" version, whereas
the status quo, you really have to plan quite carefully and think a lot at
every step of the way.

Also I'm cheating a little and using Boost.Mp11 for pack indexing.

### Pack Indexing Ambiguity

In EWGI session in Prague, James Touton pointed out the following example:

```cpp
template <typename... Ts>
struct X {
    void f(Ts...[1]);
};
```

Since C++11, this is valid syntax. `X<int, char>::f` is a non-template member
function that takes two arguments of types `int*` and `char*`. This would be
more clear if we provided a name to the function parameter and instead spelled
it `Ts... p[1]`. 

With this paper, `Ts...[1]` would have different meaning: it would be the single
type referring to the 2nd type in the pack `Ts`. In other words,
`X<int, char>::f` would instead become a non-template member function that takes
a single argument of type `char`. 

This is a problem. Thankfully, it's a very small one. Neither gcc or msvc even allow
this syntax today (clang and icc do), so that severely limits how much code exists
in the wild that uses it. It's additionally unlikely to be used much since it's
really just a very strange way to write `Ts*...` without any real benefit over
this more direct formulation. Searching for `...[` on codesearch.isocpp finds
11 uses, all of which are in compiler test cases.

The proposed resolution is that `Ts...[1]` _always_ means pack indexing. If a user
really wants the C++11 meaning, they can either name the parameter (as in 
`Ts... p[1]`) or spell it as a pointer instead (as in `Ts*...`).

## Extending Structured Bindings

See [@P2120R0].

## Packs at block scope

This section has thus far proposed the ability to declare member variable packs
and member alias packs, which can greatly help implementing a type like `tuple`.
For thoroughness, this paper also proposes the ability to declare variable
packs and alias packs at block scope. That is:

```cpp
template <typename... Ts>
void foo(Ts&&... ts) {
    using ...decayed = std::decay_t<Ts>;
    auto... copies = std::forward<Ts>(ts);
}
```

## Implementing variant

The ability to declare a member pack and index into packs would also make it
substantially easier to implement `variant`. In the same way that this paper
is proposing allowing a member pack of a class type:

```cpp
template <typename... Ts>
struct tuple {
    Ts... vals;
};
```

This paper also proposes allowing a member pack of a union type:

```cpp
template <typename... Ts>
union variant {
    Ts... alts;
};
```

This doesn't just fall out naturally in the same way the class type case does.
Packs behave as a single entity in the language today, and yet here we would
need to have a part of an entity - we wouldn't initialize the pack `alts...`, 
we would necessarily only have to initialize exactly one of element of that
pack. But I don't think that's a huge stretch. And it makes for a substantial
improvement in how user-friendly the implementation is. 

As with the earlier tuple example, with the proposed language changes, this is
something you can just sit down and implement. It practically rolls off the
page, because the language would let you express your intent better. With the
status quo, this is just a lot more design work in order to eventually produce
a lot more code that is harder to understand and takes longer to compile.

The following is an implementation solely of the default
constructor, the destructor, and `get_if`:

::: cmptable
### Status Quo
```cpp
template <size_t I, typename... Ts>
union impl { };

template <size_t I, typename T, typename... Ts>
union impl<I, T, Ts...>
{
public:
    template <typename... Args>
    constexpr impl(in_place_index_t<0>, Args&&... args)
        : head(std::forward<Args>(args)...)
    { }
    
    template <size_t J, typename... Args>
    constexpr impl(in_place_index_t<J>,
            Args&&... args)
        : tail(in_place_index<J-1>,
            std::forward<Args>(args)...)

        , impl_(in_place_index<0>)
    { }

      requires (std::is_trivially_destructible_v<Ts> && ...)
      = default;

        mp_with_index<sizeof...(Ts)>(index_,
            [](auto I) {
                auto& alt = impl.get(in_place_index<I>);
                std::destroy_at(&alt);
            });

    } else {
        return nullptr;
    }

    } else {
        return nullptr;
    }

```

## Other Examples

### Enumerating over a pack

Pack indexing would also allow for the ability to enumerate over a pack, by
iterating over the indices:

```cpp
template <typename... Ts>
void enumerate(Ts... ts)
{
    template for (constexpr auto I : views::iota(0u, sizeof...(Ts))) {
        cout << I << ' ' << ts...[I] << '\n';
    }
}
```

### `std::integer_sequence` and structured bindings

There is a paper in the pre-Cologne mailing specifially wanting to opt
`std::integer_sequence` into expansion statements [@P1789R0]. We could instead
be able to opt it into structured bindings:

```cpp
template <typename T, T... Values>
struct integer_sequence {
    using ...tuple_element = integral_constant<T, Values>;
    
    template <size_t I>
        requires (I < sizeof...(Values))
    constexpr auto get() const -> integral_constant<T, Values...[I]> {
        return {};
    }
};
```

We'll see an even more interesting use of this proposal's interaction with
`index_sequence` in a [later section](#mp-with-index).


# Expanding a type into a pack

At this point, this paper has introduced:

* the ability to declare a packs in more places (member variable and member 
alias packs as well as block scope variable and alias packs)
* the ability to index into a pack using the `pack...[I]` syntax
* an extension of structured bindings to look for a specific member alias pack
named `tuple_element`, to reduce the API footprint.

These, in of themselves, provide a lot of value. But I think there's another
big step that we could take that could provide a lot of value. This paper
has proposed the syntax `T...[I]` to be indexing into a pack, `T`.
But there's a lot of similarity between a pack of types and a tuple - which is
basically a pack of types in single type form. And while we can index into a tuple
(that's what `tuple_element` does), the syntax difference between the two is
rather large:

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Pack</th><th>Tuple</th></tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align:middle">
Types
</td><td>
```cpp
Types...[I]
```
</td>
<td>
```cpp
tuple_element_t<I, Tuple>
```
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align:middle">Values</td><td>
```cpp
vals...[I]
```
</td>
<td>
```cpp
std::get<I>(tuple)
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The problem is that we're used to having the thing we're indexing on the left
and the index on the right, and in the tuple case - this is inverted. If we
could turn the `tuple` into a pack of its constituents, we could use the pack
indexing operation. [@P1061R1], coupled with this paper thus far, would allow:

```cpp
// structured bindings can now introduce a pack, so this is a
// tuple --> pack conversion
auto [...elems] = tuple;

// pack indexing as usual
auto first = elems...[0];
```

Note also that [@P1045R1] would allow adding an `operator[]` to `tuple` such
that `tuple[0]` actually works. 

This paper proposes a more direct mechanism to accomplish this.

## Generalized unpacking with `[:]`

This paper proposes a non-overloadable `[:]` operator which can be
thought of as the "add a layer of packness" operator. The semantics of this
operator are to unpack an object into the elements that would make up its
respective structured binding declaration. For a `std::tuple`, this would mean 
calls to `std::get<0>()`, `std::get<1>()`, ... For an aggregate, this would mean
aliases into its members. For the `xstd::tuple` we defined earlier, this would
be calls into the members `get<0>()`, `get<1>(), ...`. For arrays, this would
be the elements of the array.

Once we add a layer of
packness, the entity becomes a pack - and so all the usual
rules around interacting with packs apply. 


<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Pack</th><th>Tuple</th></tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align:middle">
Types
</td><td>
```cpp
Types...[I]
```
</td>
<td>
```cpp
Tuple::[:]...[I]
```
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align:middle">Values</td><td>
```cpp
vals...[I]
```
</td>
<td>
```cpp
tuple.[:]...[I]
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

That's a fairly involved syntax for a simple and common operation, so this
paper proposes the shorthand `Tuple::[I]` for that syntax. This is not a typo.
The syntax for indexing into a pack (`Ts...[I]`) and the syntax for indexing
into a type (`Ts::[I]`) are different and it's important that they are different.
A proper discussion of the motivation for the differing syntax will
[follow](#disambiguating-packs), but the key is that these syntaxes be unambiguous.

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Pack</th><th>Tuple</th><th>Tuple, sugared</th></tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align:middle">
Types
</td><td>
```cpp
Types...[I]
```
</td>
<td>
```cpp

```cpp

</table>

This means we can take our tuple implementation from the previous section:

```cpp
namespace xstd {
    template <typename... Ts>
    class tuple {
        Ts... elems;
    public:
        tuple(Ts... ts) : elems(ts)... { }
    
        using ...tuple_element = Ts;
    
        template <size_t I> requires I < sizeof...(Ts)
        auto get() const& -> Ts...[I]& { return elems...[I]; }
    };
}
```

And that is already sufficient to write:

```cpp
xstd::tuple vals(1, 2, 3);
// direct indexing
assert(vals.[0] + vals.[1] + vals.[2] == 6);

// direct unpacking
auto sum = (vals.[:] + ...);
assert(sum == 6);
```

Here `vals.[0]` is the first structured binding, which for this tuple-like type
means `vals.get<0>()`. `vals.[:]` is the pack consisting of all of the
structured bindings, which means the pack
`{vals.get<0>(), vals.get<1>(), vals.get<2>()}`.

## Syntax-free unpacking?

The last example demonstrates the ability to turn the tuple `vals` into a pack
by way of `vals.[:]`, at which point we can do any of the nice pack things with
that entity (e.g. use a _fold-expression_, invoke a function, etc). Why do we
need that though? Can't we just have:

```cpp
auto sum = (vals + ...);
```

The problem is this direction would lead to ambiguities (as almost everything
in this space inherently does):

```cpp
template <typename T, typename... U>
void call_f(T t, U... us)
{
    // Is this intended to add 't' to each element in 'us'
    // or is intended to pairwise sum the tuple 't' and
    // the pack 'us'?
    f((t + us)...);
}
```

Both meanings are reasonable - so it's left up to the programmer to express
their intent:

```cpp
// This adds 't' to each element in 'us'
f((t + us)...);

// This adds each element in 't' to each element in 'us',
// if the two packs have different sizes, ill-formed
f((t.[:] + us)...);
```

## Other examples of unpacking

Arrays are the easiest kind of structured binding. With `[:]`, they would unpack
into all of their elements - which have the same type. Note that `arr[i]` and
`arr.[i]` mean the same thing, except that in the latter case the index must
be a constant expression.

```cpp
void bar(int, int);

int values[] = {42, 17};
bar(values.[:]...); // equivalent to bar(42, 17)
```

This directly allows unpacking types with all-public members as well:

```cpp
struct X { int i, j; };
struct Y { int k, m; };

int sum(X x, Y y) {
    // equivalent to: return x.i + x.j + y.k * y.k + y.m * y.m
    return (x.[:] + ...) + ((y.[:] * y.[:]) + ...);
}
```

And because for such types, structured binding calls the bindings themselves
aliases rather than new variables, this works with bitfields:

```cpp
struct B {
    uint8_t i : 4;
    uint8_t j: 4;
};
B b{.i = 2, .j = 4};
assert(b.[0] + b.[1] == 6);
```

### Fixed-size homogeneous pack

This also provides a direct solution to the fixed-size pack problem [@N4072]:

```cpp
template <typename T, int N>
class Vector {
public:
    // I want this to be constructible from exactly N T's. The type T[N]
    // expands directly into that
    Vector(T[N]::[:]... vals);
};
```

The type `Vector<int, 3>` will have a _non-template_ constructor that takes
three `int`s. This works because `int[3]` is a type that can be used with
structured bindings (being an array), so `int[3]::[:]` is the pack of types 
that would be the types of the bindings (i.e. `{int, int, int}`). Which then
expands into three `int`s. 

Note that this behaves differently from the homogenous variadic function packs
paper [@P1219R1] (I'm not claiming one behavior is better than the other -
just noting the difference):

```cpp
template <typename T, int N>
class Vector2 {
public:
    // independently deduces each ts and requires that
    // they all deduce to T. As opposed to the previous
    // implementation which behaves as if the constructor
    // were not a template, just that it took N T's.
    Vector2(T... ts) requires (sizeof...(ts) == N);
};
```

For instance:

```cpp
Vector<int, 2>  x('a', 2); // ok
Vector2<int, 2> y('a', 2); // ill-formed, deduction failure
```

### Construct a `tuple` from a `pair` {#tuple-pair}

We can also simplify the example we saw earlier where we were constructing
a `tuple` from a `pair`:

```cpp
namespace xstd {
    template <typename... Ts>
    class tuple {
    public:
        template <std::convertible_to<Ts>... Us>
        constexpr tuple(std::pair<Us...> const& p)
            : elems(p.[:])...
        { }
    private:
        Ts... elems;
    };
}
```

### Implementing `make_index_sequence` without a compiler builtin {#mp-with-index}

You have always been able to implement a version of `make_index_sequence` that
would decompose into a sequence of integral constants:

```cpp
template <size_t N>
struct index_seq {
    template <size_t I>
    constexpr auto get() const -> std::integral_constant<size_t, I> {
        return {};
    }
};

namespace std {
    template <size_t N>
    struct tuple_size<index_seq<N>>
        : integral_constant<size_t, N>
    { };
    
    template <size_t I, size_t N>
    struct tuple_element<I, index_seq<N>> {
        using type = integral_constant<size_t, I>;
    };
}

// a is an integral_constant<size_t, 0>
// b is an integral_constant<size_t, 1>
auto [a, b] = index_seq<2>();
```

But this is actually totally useless because you need to know the number of
identifiers to declare. With [@P1061R1], this becomes useful since you can write

```cpp
auto [...Is] = index_seq<N>();
```

and now you don't need to indirect through a lambda. With this proposal, it
becomes more useful still since you don't even need the extra declaration. 
You can implement Boost.Mp11's [`mp_with_index`](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/develop/libs/mp11/doc/html/mp11.html#mp_with_indexni_f)
in a one liner:

```cpp
template <size_t N, typename F>
decltype(auto) with_index(size_t i, F fn)
{	
	return array{
        +[](F& f) -> decltype(auto) { return f(index_seq<N>{}.[:]); }...
    }[i](fn);
}
```

## Generalizing slicing further

The reason the syntax `[:]` is chosen as the "add a layer of packness" operator
is because it allows a further generlization. Similar to Python's syntax for
slicing, this paper proposes to provide indexes on one side or the other of
the `:` to take just sections of the pack. 

For instance, `T::[1:]` is all but the first element of the type. `T::[:-1]`
is all but the last element of the type. `T::[2:3]` is a pack consisting of
only the third element.

Such a feature would provide an easy way to write a `std::visit` that takes
the variants first and the function last:

```cpp
template <typename... Args>
constexpr decltype(auto) better_visit(Args&&... args) {
    return std::visit(
        // the function first
        std::forward<Args...[-1]>(args...[-1]),
        // all the variants next
        // note that both slices on both Args and args are necessary, otherwise
        // we end up with two packs of different sizes that need to get expanded
        std::forward<Args...[:-1]>(args...[:-1])...);
}
```

The seemingly excessive amount of dots is actually necessary. `args` is a pack,
`args...` unpacks it, `args...[:-1]` adds a layer of pack on it again - so it
again needs to be expanded. Hence, `args...[:-1]...` is a pack expansion
consisting of all but the last element of the pack (which would be ill-formed
for an empty pack). 

It would also allow for a single-overload variadic fold:

```cpp
template <typename F, typename Z, typename... Ts>
constexpr Z fold(F f, Z z, Ts... rest)
{
    if constexpr (sizeof...(rest) == 0) {
        return z;
    } else {
        // we need to invoke f on z and the first elem in rest...
        // and recurse, passing the rest of rest...
        return fold(f,
            f(z, rest...[0]),
            rest...[1:]...);

        // alternate formulation
        auto head = rest...[0];
        auto ...tail = rest...[1:];
        return fold(f, f(z, head), tail...);
    }
}
```

## Examples with Boost.Mp11

Boost.Mp11 works by treating any variadic class template as a type list and
providing operations that just work. A common pattern in the implementation
of many of the metafunctions is to indirect to a class template specialization
to do the pattern matching on the pack. This paper provides a more direct
way to implement many of the facilities.

We just need one helper that we will reuse every time (as opposed to each
metafunction needing its own helper):

```cpp
template <class L> struct pack_impl;
template <template <class...> class L, class... Ts>
struct pack_impl<L<Ts...>> {
    // a pack alias for the template arguments
    using ...tuple_element = Ts;
    
    // an alias template for the class template itself
    template <typename... Us> using apply = L<Us...>;
};

template <class L, class... Us>
using apply_pack_impl = typename pack_impl<L>::template apply<Us...>;
```

::: cmptable

### Boost.Mp11 
```cpp
template <class L> struct mp_front_impl;
template <template <class...> class L, class T, class... Ts>
struct mp_front_impl<L<T, Ts...>> {
    using type = T;
};

template <class L>
using mp_front = typename mp_front_impl<L>::type;
```

# Can functions return a pack?

The previous draft of this paper [@P1858R0] also proposed the ability to have
a function return a pack. This revision removes that part of the proposal. 
Consider:

```cpp
void observe();
void consume(auto...);

template <typename... Ts>
struct copy_tuple {
    Ts... elems;
    
    Ts... get() const {
        observe();
        return elems;
    }
};

copy_tuple<X, Y, Z> tuple(x, y, z);

// #1
consume(tuple.get()...);

// #2
consume(tuple.get()...[0]);

// #3
consume(tuple.get()...[0], tuple.get()...[1]);
```

There are two questions we have to answer for each call to `consume` there:

1. How many times is `observe()` invoked?
2. How many times are the `X`, `Y`, and `Z` copied?

There are two models we can think about for how the `get()` function might work:

### Language Tuple {-}

`get()` behaves as if it returns a language tuple. That is, it's syntax sugar
for:

```cpp
tuple<Ts...> get() const {
    observe();
    return {elems...};
}
```

Except that it's already a pack. With this model, every call to `get()` calls
`observe()` a single time and copies every element.

### Pack of functions {-}

`get()` behaves as if it declares a pack of functions. That is, it's syntax sugar
for:

```cpp
Ts...[0] get<0>() const {
    observe();
    return elems...[0];
}

Ts...[1] get<1>() const {
    observe();
    return elems...[1];
}

// etc.
```

With this model, each individual element access incurs a call to `observe()`,
but only the desired element is copied.

### Which is better? {-}

The problem is, both models are reasonable mental models and yet both models
lead to some jarringly strange results:

- If we consider the language tuple model, then the example `#3` -
`consume(tuple.get()...[0], tuple.get()...[1])` - would end up copying every
element in the tuple, twice. Six copies, to get two elements?

- If we consider the pack of functions mode, then the example `#1` - 
`consume(tuple.get()...)` - would end up calling `observe()` three times. But
it only looks like we're invoking a single function?

I don't think either model is better than the other, so this paper punts on
this problem entirely. There is no longer a proposal to allow functions returning
packs.

# Disambiguation

There are many aspects of this proposal that require careful disambiguation.
This section goes through those cases in turn. 

## Disambiguating Dependent Packs {#disambiguating-dependent}

If we have a dependent name that's a pack, we need a way to disambiguate that
it's actually a pack. From [@Smith.Pack]:

::: quote
```cpp
template<typename T> void call_f(T t) {
  f(t.x ...)
}
```
Right now, this is ill-formed (no diagnostic required) because "t.x" does not 
contain an unexpanded parameter pack. But if we allow class members to be pack 
expansions, this code could be valid -- we'd lose any syntactic mechanism to 
determine whether an expression contains an unexpanded pack. This is fatal to at 
least one implementation strategy for variadic templates.
:::

We need some kind of disambiguation. Perhaps some sort of
context-sensitive keyword like `pack`?

```cpp
template <typename T>
    requires (sizeof...(T::pack tuple_element))
//                      ~~~^^^^^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
struct tuple_size<T>
    : integral_constant<size_t, sizeof...(T::pack tuple_element)>
    //                                    ~~~^^^^^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{ };
```

Unfortunately that doesn't work because of the possibility of something
like:

```cpp
template<typename ...Ts> struct X { using ...types = Ts; };
template<typename MyX> void f() {
  using Fn = void(typename MyX::pack types ...);
}
```

Today that's declaring a function type that takes one argument of type
`typename MyX::pack` named `types` and then varargs with the comma elided. If
we make the comma mandatory (as [@P1219R1] proposes to do), then that would open
up our ability to use a context-sensitive `pack` here. 

Otherwise, we would need a new keyword to make this happen, and `pack` seems entirely too
pretty to make this work. One thing we could consider is <code>[packname]{.kw}</code> - which
has the pleasant feature of having the same number of letters in it as both
`template` and `typename`. But this paper suggests going a different direction
instead.

### Pack introducers {#introducers}

As a brief aside, it's worth enumerating the places in the language where we
can introduce a pack today - because they all have an important feature in common:

```cpp
template <typename ...T> // template parameter pack
void f(T ...t)           // function parameter pack
{
   [...u=t]{};           // init-capture pack
}
```

What these have in common is that is that the `...` always _precedes_ the name
that it introduces as a pack. 

### Proposed disambigutation

To that end, an appropriate and consistent mechanism to disambiguate a dependent
member pack might also be to use _preceding_ ellipses (which still need to be
separated by a space). That is:

```cpp
template <typename T>
    requires (sizeof...(T::...tuple_element))
struct tuple_size<T>
    : integral_constant<size_t, sizeof...(T::...tuple_element)>
{ };
```

And once we disambiguated that `T::tuple_element` is a pack, we still need
to expand it - which may also require trailing ellipses:

```
template <size_t I, typename T>
    requires (sizeof...(T::...tuple_element))
struct tuple_element<I, T>
{
    using type = T::...tuple_element...[I];
};
```

That's admittedly a lot of dots fairly close together. If that isn't acceptable,
then we can introduce a new disambiguating keyword:

```
template <size_t I, typename T>
    requires (sizeof...(T::packname tuple_element))
struct tuple_element<I, T>
{
    using type = T::packname tuple_element...[I];
};
```

## Disambiguating packs of tuples {#disambiguating-packs}

The previous section showed how to write `apply` taking a single function and a
single tuple. What if we generalized it to taking multiple tuples? How do we
handle a pack of tuples?

It's at this point that it's worth taking a step back and talking about
disambiguation and why this paper makes the syntax choices that it makes. We need
to be able to differentiate between packs and tuples. The two concepts are very
similar, and this paper seeks to make them much more similar, but we still need
to differentiate between them. It's the pack of tuples case that really brings
the ambiguity to light. 

The rules this paper proposes, which have all been introduced at this point, 
are:

- `e.[:]` takes a [_pack-like type_](#pack-like-type)
(or object of such) and adds a layer of packness
to it, by way of structured bindings. It never is applied to
an existing pack, and it is never used to disambiguate dependent member access.

- `e.[I]` never removes a layer of packness. It is picking the `I`th element of
a pack-like type.

- `e...[I]` always removes a layer of packness. It is picking the `I`th element
of a pack.

- `e. ...f` disambiguates dependent member access and identifies `f` as a pack
The space between the `.` and `...` is required. 

That is, `pack...[I]` and `tuple.[I]` are valid, `tuple...[I]` is an error, and
`pack.[I]` would be applying `.[I]` to each element of the pack (and is itself
still an unexpanded pack expression). Rule of thumb: you need `...`s if and only
if you have a pack. 

`e.[I]` is an equivalent shorthand for `e.[:]...[I]`.

This leads to clear meanings of each of the following. If we have a function
template taking an argument `e` which has a member `f`, where the kind of `e`
is specified by the columns of this table and the kind of `f` is specified by
the rows:

<table>
<tr><td /><th>`e` is a Pack</th><th>`e` is a Pack-like type</th><th>`e` is not expanded</th></tr>
<tr>
<th>`f` is a Pack</th>
<td>`foo(e. ...f... ...);`</td>
<td>`foo(e.[:]. ...f... ...);`</td>
<td>`foo(e. ...f...);`</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>`f` is a Pack-like type</th>
<td>`foo(e.f.[:]... ...);`</td>
<td>`foo(e.[:].f.[:]... ...);`</td>
<td>`foo(e.f.[:]...);`</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>`f` is not expanded</th>
<td>`foo(e.f...);`</td>
<td>`foo(e.[:].f...);`</td>
<td>`foo(e.f);`</td>
</table>

The only two valid cells in that table in C++20 are the bottom-left and bottom-right
ones. Note that every cell has different syntax, by design.

## Nested pack expansions

In order for the above table to work at all, we also need a new kind of pack
expansion. When C++11 introduced pack expansion, the rules were very simple:
The expression in `expr...` must contain at least one unexpanded pack expression
and every unexpanded pack expression must have the same length.

But with the concepts introduced in this proposal, we have the ability to
introduce new things that behave like unexpanded pack expressions within an 
unexpanded pack expression and we need to define rules for that. Consider:

```cpp
template <typename... Ts>
void foo(Ts... e) {
    bar(e.[:]... ...);
}

// what does this do?
foo(xstd::tuple{1}, xstd::tuple{2, 3});
```

Following the rules presented above, `e.[:]` adds a layer of packness to each
element in the pack (which is fine because `xstd::tuple`s are structured-
bindable). But what then do the `...`s refer to?

We say that adding layer of packness in the middle of an existing unexpanded
pack expression will hang a new, nested unexpanded pack expression onto that.

In the above example, `e` is an unexpanded pack expression. `e.[:]` is a nested
unexpanded pack expression underneath `e`.

When we encounter the the first `...`, we say that it expands the most nested
unexpanded pack expression that of the expression that it refers to. The most
nested unexpanded pack expression here is `e.[:]`,
which transforms the expression into:

```cpp
bar((e.[0], e.[1], e.[2], /* etc. */, e.[M-1])...);
```

This isn't really valid C++ code (or, worse, it actually is valid but would use
the comma operator rather than having `M` arguments). But the idea is we now have
one more `...` which now has a single unexpanded pack expression to be expanded,
which is the unexpanded pack expression that expands each element in a pack-like
type. 

A different way of looking at is the outer-most `...` expands the outer-most
unexpanded pack expression, keeping the inner ones in tact. If we only touch
the outer-most `...`, we end up with the following transformation:

```cpp
bar(e@~0~@.[:]..., e@~1~@.[:]..., /* etc. */, e@~N-1~@.[:]...);
```

The two interpretations are isomorphic, though the latter is likely easier to
understand.

Either way, the full answer to what does `foo(xstd::tuple{1}, xstd::tuple{2, 3})`
do in this example is that it calls `bar(1, 2, 3)`.

For more concrete examples, here is a generalized `apply()` which can take
many tuples and expand them in order:

```cpp
template <typename F, typename... Tuples>
constexpr decltype(auto) apply(F&& f, Tuples&&... tuples) {
    return std::invoke(
        std::forward<F>(f),
        std::forward<Tuples>(tuples).[:]... ...);
}
```

which, again more concretely, expands into something like:

```cpp
template <typename F, typename T@~0~@, typename T@~1~@, ..., typename T@~N-1~@>
constexpr decltype(auto) apply(F&& f, T@~0~@ t@~0~@, T@~1~@ t@~1~@, ..., T@~N-1~@ t@~N-1~@) {
    return std::invoke(std::forward<F>(f),
        std::forward<T@~0~@>(t@~0~@).[:]...,
        std::forward<T@~1~@>(t@~1~@).[:]...,
        ...
        std::forward<T@~N-1~@>(t@~N-1~@).[:]...);
}
```

And then we unpack each of these `...`s through the appropriate structured bindings
rules.

Similarly, `tuple_cat` would be:

```cpp
template <typename... Tuples>
constexpr std::tuple<Tuples.[:]... ...> tuple_cat(Tuples&&... tuples) {
    return {std::forward<Tuples>(tuples).[:]... ...};
}
```

And itself leads to a different implementation of generalized `apply`:

```cpp
template <typename F, typename... Tuples>
constexpr decltype(auto) apply(F&& f, Tuples&&... tuples) {
    return std::invoke(
        std::forward<F>(f),
        tuple_cat(std::forward<Tuples>(tuples)...).[:]...
}
```

Admittedly, six `.`s is a little cryptic. But is it any worse than the current
implementation?


# What about Reflection?

Two recent reflection papers ([@P1240R0] and [@P1717R0]) provide solutions for
some of the problems this paper is attempting to solve. What follows is my best
attempt to compare the reflection solutions to the generalized pack solutions
presented here. I am not entirely sure about the examples on the left, but
hopefully they are at least close enough to correct to be able to evaluate the
differences.

Note that one notable example missing here is a constructor for `tuple` - I
really don't know how to implement any of those constructors on top of reflection.

:::

It's not that I think that the reflection direction is bad, or isn't useful. Far
from. It's just that dealing with `tuple` is, in no small part, an ergonomics
problem and I don't think any reflection proposal that I've seen so far can
adequately address that: neither from the perspective of declaring a pack (as
in for `tuple` or `variant`) nor from the perspective of unpacking a tuple
into a function or other expression.

If reflection can produce something much closer to what is being proposed here,
I would happily table this proposal. But it seems to me that it's fairly far
off, and the functionality presented herein would be very useful. 

# What about `std::pair`?

As shocking as it might be to hear, there are in fact other types in the
standard library that are neither `std::tuple<Ts...>` nor `std::variant<Ts...>`.
We should probably consider how to fit those other types into this new world.

The nice thing about implementing `tuple` with the new structured bindings
direction is that because everything `tuple` is already a pack, staying in the
pack world remains very easy. But `pair` doesn't have any packs, so it is
missing out:

```cpp
namespace xstd {
    template <typename T, typename U>
    struct pair {
        T first;
        U second;
        
        using ...tuple_element = ????;
        
        template <size_t I>
        auto get() const& -> tuple_element...[I] const&
        {
            if constexpr (I == 0) return first;
            else if constepxr (I == 1) return second;
        }
    };
}
```

How would we fill in the `????`s here? We need a pack there.

We could implement this in terms of tuple. `tuple<T, U>::[:]` is a pack of
two types, `T` and `U`. This works directly with the proposal as presented. It's
also a little odd, and indirect. But it works.

We could also come up with a way to introduce the pack we need directly, in-line,
by way of a pack literal. Borrowing from the insight about how
[pack introducers](#introducers) work, this would either be `...<T, U>` (using
the syntax from [@P0341R0] with the extra preceding ellipsis) or `...{T, U}`
(which would be in line with how gcc reports template errors when packs are
involved).

A pack literal direction would also lead to a pack literal of values, which
would add more fun with initialization:

```cpp
auto    a = {1, 2, 3}; // a is a std::initializer_list<int>
auto... b = {1, 2, 3}; // b is a pack of int's
```

Those two declarations are very different. But also, they look different - one
has `...` and the other does not. One looks like it is declaring an object and
the other looks like it is declaring a pack. 

Pack literals would also allow for adding default arguments to packs:

```cpp
template <typename... Ts = ...<int>>
void foo(Ts... ts = ...{0});

foo(); // calls foo<int>(0);
```

I'm not sure if this is sufficiently motivated to pursue, but would be curious
to hear what people think about this matter. 

# One paper or many

R1 [@P1858R1] of this paper included several features that build on each other:

1. Declaring packs in more places, and a disambiguation for dependent pack access.
2. An extension to the structured bindings protocol to simplify the opt-in by
using a pack.
3. Indexing into a pack. 
4. Turning a type into a pack. 
5. Slicing a pack. 

EWGI in Prague [@EWGI.Prague], took two votes about separating these features:

1. Split the structured binding customization point changes into another paper? 3-8-5-1-1.
2. Split the indexing facilities into another paper? 2-2-9-3-1.

Many of the aspects of this proposal do seem separable. Indexing into a pack is
nominally independent of declaring more packs, and both are nominally independent
of turning a type into a pack. However, I think it's important to see the broad
vision of what I want future pack facilities to look like - and it's especially
important in this space to ensure that all the facilities properly interoperate.
It's very easy to have issues with ambiguities here. All the syntax decisions
were driven by the need to have every syntax look different from every other
syntax in all contexts. Having all of the syntax-introducing proposals in a single
paper ensures that they need to be considered as a cohesive whole and that they
will be able to work together properly.

Of course, none of that argument applies to the structured bindings customization
aspect of the initial proposal - it's a small, self contained improvement that
has no ambiguity concerns and really only affects structured bindings. Which is
why that part, and only that part, has been split off into its own proposal:
[@P2120R0].

# Proposal

All the separate bits and pieces of this proposal have been presented one step
at a time during the course of this paper. This section will formalize all
the important notions. 

## Pack declarations

You can declare member variable packs, namespace-scope variable packs, and
block-scope variable packs. You can declare alias packs. The initializer for a
pack declaration has to be an unexpanded pack - which would then be expanded.

## Dependent packs

Member packs and block scope packs can be directly unpacked
when in non-dependent contexts. We know what they are.

In dependent contexts, anything that is not a pack must be explicitly identified
as a pack in order to be treated as one. Similar to how we need the `typename`
and `template` keyword in many places to identify that such and such an expression
is a type or a template, a preceding `...` (or whatever alternate spelling)
will identify the expression that
follows it as a pack. If that entity is _not_ a pack, then
the indexing or unpacking expression is ill-formed.

Non-dependent packs do not need any disambiguation (the disambiguation is
allowed, but unnecessary).

## Pack Indexing

A pack can be indexed by expanding it and applying `[I]` to the result.
`p...[0]` is the first element of the pack `p` (which can be a value, type, or
template based on the kind of pack that `p` is).

This is a "sfinae-friendly" operation, so given:

```cpp
template <typenae... Ts>
auto first(Ts... ts) -> Ts...[0] {
    return ts...[0];
}
```

`first()` triggers a substitution failure, rather than a hard error.

## Adding a layer of packness

Given a value of a type that can be used on the right-hand side of a structured
binding declaration, the `.[:]` operator may be applied to "add a layer of
packness" - turning it into a pack of values consisting of what the structured
bindings would have been.

A type that can be used in structured bindings can have the `::[:]` operator
applied to it to likewise turn it into a pack of types.

```cpp
void f(std::tuple<int, char, double> t) {
    // equivalent to g(std::get<0>(t), std::get<1>(t), std::get<2>(t))
    // or, possibly, std::apply(g, t)
    g(t.[:]...);
    
    // decltype(u) is the same as T - just a really complex way to
    // get there
    using T = decltype(t);
    std::tuple<T::[:]...> u = t;
}
```

The syntaxes `v.[I]` and `T::[I]` are shorthand for the syntaxes
`v.[:]...[I]` and `T::[:]...[I]`, respectively.

## Pack slicing

While `.[:]` and `::[:]` add a layer of packness, turning the expression into
a pack consisting of all of the underlying elements, the slice notation can
also include either a start or end index, or both, to get just part of the pack.

```cpp
void h(std::tuple<int, char, double> t) {
    // a is a tuple<int, char, double>
    auto a = std::tuple(t.[:]...);
    
    // b is a tuple<char, double>
    auto b = std::tuple(t.[1:]...);
    
    // c is a tuple<int, char>
    auto c = std::tuple(t.[:-1]...);
    
    // d is a tuple<char>
    auto d = std::tuple(t.[1:2]...);
}
```
