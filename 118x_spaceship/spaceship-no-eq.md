# Revision History

R1 of this paper was presented to Evolution in Kona, who preferred that defaulted `operator<=>` unconditionally declares defaulted `operator==`. This has been noted in the questions section.

R0 of this paper was approved in its entirety by Evolution in San Diego. This new revision contains brand new wording after core review. There were two [design questions](#core-design-questions) brought up by Core during this review, both based on the meaning of implicitly generated `==`, which are discussed in this revision.

# Motivation

[P0515](https://wg21.link/p0515r3) introduced `operator<=>` as a way of generating all six comparison operators from a single function, as well as the ability to default this so as to avoid writing any code at all. See David Stone's [I did not order this!](https://wg21.link/p1190r0) for a very clear, very thorough description of the problem: it does not seem to be possible to implement `<=>` optimally for "wrapper" types. What follows is a super brief run-down.

Consider a type like:

    :::cpp
    struct S {
        vector<string> names;
        auto operator<=>(S const&) const = default;
    };

Today, this is ill-formed, because `vector` does not implement `<=>`. In order to make this work, we need to add that implementation. It is _not_ recommended that `vector` only provide `<=>`, but we will start there and it will become clear why that is the recommendation.

The most straightforward implementation of `<=>` for `vector` is (let's just assume `strong_ordering` and note that I'm deliberately not using `std::lexicographical_compare_3way()` for clarity):

    :::cpp
    template<typename T>
    strong_ordering operator<=>(vector<T> const& lhs, vector<T> const& rhs) {
        size_t min_size = min(lhs.size(), rhs.size());
        for (size_t i = 0; i != min_size; ++i) {
            if (auto const cmp = compare_3way(lhs[i], rhs[i]); cmp != 0) {
                return cmp;
            }
        }
        return lhs.size() <=> rhs.size();
    }

On the one hand, this is great. We wrote one function instead of six, and this function is really easy to understand too. On top of that, this is a really good implementation for `<`!  As good as you can get. And our code for `S` works (assuming we do something similar for `string`).

On the other hand, as David goes through in a lot of detail (seriously, read it) this is quite bad for `==`. We're failing to short-circuit early on size differences! If two containers have a large common prefix, despite being different sizes, that's an enormous amount of extra work!

In order to do `==` efficiently, we have to short-circuit and do `==` all the way down. That is:

    :::cpp
    template<typename T>
    bool operator==(vector<T> const& lhs, vector<T> const& rhs)
    {
        // short-circuit on size early
        const size_t size = lhs.size();
        if (size != rhs.size()) {
            return false;
        }

        for (size_t i = 0; i != size; ++i) {
            // use ==, not <=>, in all nested comparisons
            if (lhs[i] != rhs[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

## Why this is really bad

This is really bad on several levels, significant levels.

First, since `==` falls back on `<=>`, it's easy to fall into the trap that once `v1 == v2` compiles and gives the correct answer, we're done. If we didn't implement the efficient `==`, outside of very studious code review, we'd have no way of finding out. The problem is that `v1 <=> v2 == 0` would always give the _correct_ answer (assuming we correctly implemented `<=>`). How do you write a test to ensure that we did the short circuiting? The only way you could do it is to time some pathological case - comparing a vector containing a million entries against a vector containing those same million entries plus `1` - and checking if it was fast?

Second, the above isn't even complete yet. Because even if we were careful enough to write `==`, we'd get an efficient `v1 == v2`... but still an inefficient `v1 != v2`, because that one would call `<=>`. We would have to also write this manually:

    :::cpp
    template<typename T>
    bool operator!=(vector<T> const& lhs, vector<T> const& rhs)
    {
        return !(lhs == rhs);
    }

Third, this compounds _further_ for any types that have something like this as a member. Getting back to our `S` above:

    :::cpp
    struct S {
        vector<string> names;
        auto operator<=>(S const&) const = default;
    };

Even if we correctly implemented `==`, `!=`, and `<=>` for `vector` and `string`, comparing two `S`s for equality _still_ calls `<=>` and is _still_ a completely silent pessimization. Which _again_ we cannot test functionally, only with a timer.

And then, it somehow gets even worse, because it's be easy to fall into yet another trap: you somehow have the diligence to remember that you need to explicitly define `==` for this type and you do it this way:

    :::cpp
    struct S {
        vector<string> names;
        auto operator<=>(S const&) const = default;
        bool operator==(S const&) const = default; // problem solved, right?
    };

But what does defaulting `operator==` actually do? It [invokes `<=>`](http://eel.is/c++draft/class.rel.eq "[class.rel.eq]"). So here's explicit code that seems sensible to add to attempt to address this problem, that does absolutely nothing to address this problem.

The only way to get efficiency is to have every type, even `S` above, implement both not just `<=>` but also `==` and `!=`. By hand.

    :::cpp
    struct S {
        vector<string> names;
        auto operator<=>(S const&) const = default;
        bool operator==(S const& rhs) const { return names == rhs.names; }
        bool operator!=(S const& rhs) const { return names != rhs.names; }
    };

That is the status quo today and the problem that needs to be solved.


## Other Languages

In order how to best figure out how to solve this problem for C++, it is helpful to look at how other languages have already addressed this issue. While P0515 listed many languages which have a three-way comparison returning a signed integer, there is another set of otherwise mostly-unrelated languages that take a different approach.

### Rust

Rust, Kotlin, Swift, Haskell, and Scala are rather different languages in many respects. But they all solve this particular problem in basically the same way: they treat _equality_ and _comparison_ as separate operations. I want to focus specifically on Rust here as it's arguably the closest language to C++ of the group, but the other three are largely equivalent for the purposes of this specific discussion.

Rust deals in Traits (which are roughly analogous to C++0x concepts and Swift protocols) and it has four relevant Traits that have to do with comparisons:

- `PartialEq` (which is a partial equivalence relation spelled which only requires symmetry and transitivity)
- `Eq` (which extends `PartialEq`, adding reflexivity)
- `PartialOrd` (which allows for incomparability by returning `Option<Ordering>`, where `Ordering` is an enum)
- `Ord` (a total order, which extends `Eq` and `PartialOrd`)

The actual operators are [implicitly generated][rust.oper] from these traits, but not all from the same one. Importantly, `x == y` is translated as `PartialEq::eq(x, y)` whereas ` x < y` is translated as `PartialOrd::lt(x, y)` (which is effectively checking that `PartialOrd::partial_cmp(x, y)` is `Less`).

That is, you don't get *six* functions for the price of one. You need to write _two functions_.

Even if you don't know Rust (and I really don't know Rust), I think it would be instructive here would be to look at how the equivalent comparisons are implemented for Rust's `vector` type. The important parts look like this:

    }
</td>

</table>

In other words, `eq` calls `eq` all the way down while doing short-circuiting whereas `cmp` calls `cmp` all the way down, and these are two separate functions. Both algorithms exactly match our implementation of `==` and `<=>` for `vector` above. Even though `cmp` performs a 3-way ordering, and you can use the result of `a.cmp(b)` to determine that `a == b`, it is _not_ the way that Rust (or other languages in this realm like Swift and Kotlin and Haskell) determine equality.

### Other Languages

Swift has [`Equatable`][swift.eq] and [`Comparable`][swift.comp] protocols. For types that conform to `Equatable`, `!=` is implicitly generated from `==`. For types that conform to `Comparable`, `>`, `>=`, and `<=` are implicitly generated from `<`. Swift does not have a 3-way comparison function.

There are other languages that make roughly the same decision in this regard that Rust does: `==` and `!=` are generated from a function that does equality whereas the four relational operators are generated from a three-way comparison. Even though the three-way comparison _could_ be used to determine equality, it is not:

- Kotlin, like Java, has a [`Comparable`][kotlin.comp] interface and a separate `equals` method inherited from [`Any`][kotlin.any]. Unlike Java, it has [operator overloading][kotlin.oper]: `a == b` means `a?.equals(b) ?: (b === null)` and `a < b` means `a.compareTo(b) < 0`.
- Haskell has the [`Data.Eq`][haskell.eq] and [`Data.Ord`][haskell.ord] type classes. `!=` is generated from `==` (or vice versa, depending on which definition is provided for `Eq`). If a `compare` method is provided to conform to `Ord`, `a < b` means `(compare a b) < 0`.
- Scala's equality operators come from the root [`Any`][scala.any] interface, `a == b` means `if (a eq null) b eq null else a.equals(b)`. Its relational operators come from the [`Ordered`][scala.ord] trait, where `a < b` means `(a compare b) < 0`.

# Proposal

Fundamentally, we have two sets of operations: equality and comparison. In order to be efficient and not throw away performance, we need to implement them separately. `operator<=>()` as specified in the working draft today generating all six functions just doesn't seem to be a good solution.

This paper proposes to do something similar to the Rust model above and first described in [this section](https://github.com/davidstone/isocpp/blob/master/operator-spaceship/I-did-not-order-this.md#make-operator-create-only-operator-operator-operator-and-operator) of the previously linked paper: require two separate functions to implement all the functionality.

The proposal has two core components:

- change the candidate set for operator lookup
- change the meaning of defaulted equality operators

And two optional components:

- change how we define [_strong structural equality_](http://eel.is/c++draft/class.compare#def:equality,strong_structural "[class.compare]"), which is important for [P0732R2](https://wg21.link/p0732r2)
- change defaulted `<=>` to also generate a defaulted `==`


## Change the candidate set for operator lookup

Today, lookup for any of the relational and equality operators will also consider [`operator<=>`](http://eel.is/c++draft/over.match.oper#3.4), but preferring [the actual used operator](http://eel.is/c++draft/over.match.best#1.10).

The proposed change is for the equality operators to _not_ consider `<=>` candidates. Instead, inequality will consider equality as a candidate. In other words, here is the proposed set of candidates. There are no changes proposed for the relational operators, only for the equality ones:

In short, `==` and `!=` never invoke `<=>` implicitly.

## Change the meaning of defaulted equality operators

As mentioned earlier, in the current working draft, defaulting `==` or `!=` generates a function that invokes `<=>`. This paper proposes that defaulting `==` generates a member-wise equality comparison and that defaulting `!=` generate a call to negated `==`.

These two changes ensure that the equality operators and the relational operators remain segregated.

## Change how we define strong structural equality

[P0732R2](https://wg21.link/p0732r2) relies on _strong structural equality_ as the criteria to allow a class to be used as a non-type template parameter - which is based on having a defaulted `<=>` that itself only calls defaulted `<=>` recursively all the way down and has type either `strong_ordering` or `strong_equality`.

This criteria clashes somewhat with this proposal, which is fundamentally about not making `<=>` be about equality. So it would remain odd if, for instance, we rely on a defaulted `<=>` whose return type is `strong_equality` (which itself can never be used to determine actual equality).

We have two options here:

1. Do nothing. Do not change the rules here at all, still require defaulted `<=>` for use as a non-type template parameter. This means that there may be types which don't have a natural ordering for which we would have to both default `==` and default `<=>` (with `strong_equality`), the latter being a function that _only_ exists to opt-in to this behavior.

2. Change the definition of strong structural equality to use `==` instead. The wording here would have to be slightly more complex: define a type `T` as having strong structural equality if each subobject recursively has defaulted `==` and none of the subobjects are floating point types.

The impact of this change revolves around the code necessary to write a type that is intended to only be equality-comparable (not ordered) but also usable as a non-type template parameter: only `operator==` would be necessary.

## Change defaulted `<=>` to also generate a defaulted `==`

One of the important consequences of this proposal is that if you simply want lexicographic, member-wise, ordering for your type - you need to default _two_ functions (`==` and `<=>`) instead of just one (`<=>`):

        bool operator==(B const&) const = default;
    };
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Arguably, `A` isn't terrible here and `B` is somewhat simpler. But it makes this proposal seem like it's fighting against the promise of P0515 of making a trivial opt-in to ordering.

As an optional extension, this paper proposes that a defaulted `<=>` operator also generate a defaulted `==`. We can do this regardless of whether the return type of the defaulted `<=>` is provided or not, since even `weak_equality` implies `==`.

This change, combined with the core proposal, means that one single defaulted operator is sufficient for full comparison. The difference is that, with this proposal, we still get optimal equality.

This change may also obviate the need for the previous optional extension of changing the definition of strong structural extension. But even still, the changes are worth considering separately.

# Important implications

This proposal means that for complex types (like containers), we have to write two functions instead of just `<=>`. But we really have to do that anyway if we want performance. Even though the two `vector` functions are very similar, and for `optional` they are even more similar (see below), this seems like a very necessary change.

For compound types (like aggregates), depending on the preference of the previous choices, we either have to default to functions instead or still just default `<=>`... but we get optimal performance.

Getting back to our initial example, we would write:

    :::cpp
    struct S {
        vector<string> names;
        bool operator==(S const&) const = default; // (*) if 2.4 not adopted
        auto operator<=>(S const&) const = default;
    };

Even if we choose to require defaulting `operator==` in this example, the fact that `<=>` is no longer considered as a candidate for equality means that the worst case of forgetting this function is that equality _does not compile_. That is a substantial improvement over the alternative where equality compiles and has subtly worse performance that will be very difficult to catch.

## Implications for types that have special, but not different, comparisons

There are many kinds of types for which the defaulted comparison semantics are incorrect, but nevertheless don't have to do anything different between equality and ordering. One such example is `optional<T>`. Having to write two functions here is extremely duplicative:

As is probably obvious, the implementations of `==` and `<=>` are basically identical: the only difference is that `==` calls `==` and `<=>` calls `<=>` (or really `compare_3way`). It may be very tempting to implement `==` to just call `<=>`, but that would be wrong! It's critical that `==` call `==` all the way down.

It's important to keep in mind three things.

1. In C++17 we'd have to write six functions, so writing two is a large improvement.
2. These two functions may be duplicated, but they give us optimal performance - writing the one `<=>` to generate all six comparison functions does not.
3. The amount of special types of this kind - types that have non-default comparison behavior but perform the same algorithm for both `==` and `<=>` - is fairly small. Most container types would have separate algorithms. Typical types default both, or just default `==`. The canonical examples that would need special behavior are `std::array` and `std::forward_list` (which either have fixed or unknown size and thus cannot short-circuit) and `std::optional` and `std::variant` (which can't do default comparison). So this particular duplication is a fairly limited problem.

## Implications for comparison categories

One of the features of P0515 is that you could default `<=>` to, instead of returning an order, simply return some kind of equality:

    :::cpp
    struct X {
        std::strong_equality operator<=>(X const&) const = default;
    };

In a world where neither `==` nor `!=` would be generated from `<=>`, this no longer makes much sense. We could have to require that the return type of `<=>` be some kind of ordering - that is, at least `std::partial_ordering`. Allowing the declaration of `X` above would be misleading, at best.

This means there may not be a way to differentiate between `std::strong_equality` and `std::weak_equality`. The only other place to do this kind of differentiation would be if we somehow allowed it in the return of `operator==`:

    :::cpp
    struct X {
        std::strong_equality operator==(X const&) const = default;
    };

And I'm not sure this makes any sense.

# Core Design Questions

The rule that this paper proposes, that EWG approved, was that if a class has an explicitly defaulted `<=>` operator function then that class will also get an implicitly generated, public, defaulted `==` operator function. This leads to two questions:

1. What happens if the explicitly defaulted `<=>` operator function is private or protected? This question was brought to Evolution and the decision was that the implicitly generated `==` operator should have the same access as the defaulted `<=>` operator.

2. What happens if the explicitly defaulted `<=>` operator is defined as deleted? There are three cases to consider here:

        :::cpp hl_lines="21"
        struct Nothing { };
        struct OnlyEq {
            bool operator==(OnlyEq const&) const;
        };
        struct Weird {
            bool operator==(Weird const&) const;
            auto operator<=>(Weird const&) const = delete;
        };

        template <typename T>
        struct wrapper {
            T t;
            auto operator<=>(wrapper const&) const = default;
        };

        template <typename T>
        bool operator==(T const&, T const&); // global, unconstrained candidate

        template <typename T>
        bool check(wrapper<T> const& x) {
            return x == x; // (*)
        }

The question is, what do `check<Nothing>`, `check<OnlyEq>`, and `check<Weird>` do?

There are several choices that we could make here. A defaulted `<=>` that is defined as deleted...

a) ... should still implicitly generate a defaulted `==`. That defaulted `==` could be defined as defaulted or deleted for its own rules.
b) ... should **not** generate a defaulted `==`.
c) ... should generated an explicitly deleted `==`.

Option (c) seems pointlessly user-hostile without much upside, so it will not be considered further. The meaning of the first two cases can be enumerated as follows:

<table>
<tr>
<th />
<th>
    :::cpp
    check<Nothing>
</th>
<th>
    :::cpp
    check<OnlyEq>
</th>
<th>
    :::cpp
    check<Weird>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>
Generate `==`
</td>
<td>
The generated `==` would be defined as deleted because `Nothing` has no `==`.

As a result, `check<Nothing>` is ill-formed.
</td>
<td>
The generated `==` would be defined as defaulted, because `OnlyEq` has an `==`.

`check<OnlyEq>` is well-formed and goes through `OnlyEq::operator==`.
</td>
<td>
The generated `==` would be defined as defaulted, because `Weird` does have an `==` despite the deleted `<=>`.

`check<Weird>` is well-formed and goes through `Weird::operator==`.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>
Do Not Generate `==`
</td>
<td colspan="3">
There is no generated `==`, so in all cases, the global candidate is invoked.
</td>
</tr>
</table>


In other words, there is a case (i.e. `Nothing`) where option 1 ends up with a deleted `==` instead of nothing and two cases (i.e. `OnlyEq` and `Weird`) where option 1 ends up with a valid and defaulted `==` instead of nothing.

The question is: what is the intent of the class author of `wrapper`? Arguably, the intent in this case is clear: just give me all the defaults. If we do not actually end up getting all the defaults (that is, `wrapper<OnlyEq>` is not equality comparable), then the class author would have to write this regardless:

    :::cpp hl_lines="4"
    template <typename T>
    struct wrapper {
        T t;
        bool operator==(wrapper const&) const = default;
        auto operator<=>(wrapper const&) const = default;
    };

Just to ensure that we really do _get the defaults_. And at that point, we've basically obviated the feature.

The intent of the proposal that defaulting `<=>` gets you defaulted `==` is very much that defaulting `<=>` really means also having declared defaulted `==`. Option B does not get us there, and Option C definitely does not get us anywhere. I believe Option A is the clear choice here.

## Answers to Core Questions

Evolution preferred that declaring `operator<=>` unconditionally declare defaulted `operator==`. Whether or not `operator<=>` is defined as deleted is orthogonal. This was option (a) above.

# Wording

Add a missing const to 10.10.1 [class.compare.default] paragraph 1, bullet 1:

> A defaulted comparison operator function ([expr.spaceship], [expr.rel], [expr.eq]) for some class `C` shall be a non-template function declared in the member-specification of `C` that is
>
> - a non-static <ins>const</ins> member of `C` having one parameter of type `const C&`, or
> - a friend of `C` having two parameters of type `const C&`.

Add a new paragraph after 10.10.1 [class.compare.default] paragraph 1:

> <ins>If the class definition does not explicitly declare an `==` operator function, but declares a defaulted three-way comparison operator function, an `==` operator function is declared implicitly with the same access as the three-way comparison operator function. The implicitly-declared `==` operator for a class `X` is an inline member and is defined as defaulted in the definition of `X`. If the three-way comparison operator function is declared as a non-static const member, the implicitly-declared `==` operator function is a member of the form</ins>

> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ins><code>bool X::operator==(const X&) const</code></ins>

> <ins>Otherwise, the implicitly-declared `==` operator function is of the form</ins>

> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ins><code>friend bool operator==(const X&, const X&)</code></ins>

> <ins>The operator is a `constexpr` function if its definition would satisfy the requirements for a `constexpr` function. <i>[ Note: </i> the `==` operator function is declared implicitly even if the defaulted three-way comparison operator function is defined as deleted. <i> - end note]</i>

Replace 10.10.1 [class.compare.default] paragraph 2:

> <del>A three-way comparison operator for a class type `C` is a _structural comparison operator_ if it is defined as defaulted in the definition of `C`, and all three-way comparison operators it invokes are structural comparison operators. A type `T` has _strong structural equality_ if, for a glvalue `x` of type `const T`, `x <=> x` is a valid expression of type `std​::​strong_ordering` or `std​::​strong_equality` and either does not invoke a three-way comparison operator or invokes a structural comparison operator.</del>

with:

> <ins>A type `C` has _strong structural equality_ if, given a glvalue `x` of type `const C`, either:</ins>
>
- <ins>`C` is a non-class type and `x <=> x` is a valid expression of type `std::strong_ordering` or `std::strong_equality`, or</ins>
- <ins>`C` is a class type with an `==` operator defined as defaulted in the definition of `C`, `x == x` is well-formed when contextually converted to `bool`, all of `C`'s base class subobjects and non-static data members have strong structural equality, and `C` has no `mutable` or `volatile` subobjects.</ins>

Move most of 10.10.2 [class.spaceship] paragraph 1 into a new paragraph at the end of 10.10.1 [class.compare.default]:

> <ins>The direct base class subobjects of C, in the order of their declaration in the base-specifier-list of C, followed
by the non-static data members of C, in the order of their declaration in the member-specification of C,
form a list of subobjects. In that list, any subobject of array type is recursively expanded to the sequence
of its elements, in the order of increasing subscript. Let <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> be an lvalue denoting the i
th element in the expanded list of subobjects for an object x (of length n), where <code>x<sub>i</sub></code>
is formed by a sequence of derived-to-base conversions (11.3.3.1), class member access expressions (7.6.1.5), and array subscript expressions (7.6.1.1)
applied to x. It is unspecified whether virtual base class subobjects appear more than once in the expanded list of subobjects.</ins>

Before 10.10.2 [class.spaceship], insert a new subclause [class.eq] referring specifically to equality and inequality containing the following:

> <ins>A defaulted equality operator (7.6.10) function shall have a declared return type `bool`.

> <ins>A defaulted `==` operator function for a class `C` is defined as deleted unless, for each <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> in the expanded list of subobjects for an object `x` of type `C`, <code>x<sub>i</sub> == x<sub>i</sub></code> is a valid expression and contextually convertible to `bool`.

> <ins>The return value `V` of a defaulted `==` operator function with parameters `x` and `y` is determined by comparing corresponding elements <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> in the expanded lists of subobjects for `x` and `y` until the first index `i` where <code>x<sub>i</sub> == y<sub>i</sub></code> yields a result value which, when contextually converted to bool, yields `false`. If no such index exists, `V` is `true`. Otherwise, `V` is `false`.</ins>

> <ins>A defaulted `!=` operator function for a class `C` with parameters `x` and `y` is defined as deleted if</ins>

> - <ins>overload resolution ([over.match]), as applied to `x == y` (also considering synthesized candidates with reversed order of parameters ([over.match.oper])), results in an ambiguity or a function that is deleted or inaccessible from the operator function, or</ins>
> - <ins>`x == y` or `y == x` cannot be contextually converted to `bool`.</ins>

> <ins>Otherwise, the operator function yields `(x == y) ? false : true` if an operator `==` with the original order of parameters was selected, or `(y == x) ? false : true` otherwise.</ins>

<blockquote><ins><i>[Example -</i>
<pre><code>struct D {
  int i;
  friend bool operator==(const D& x, const D& y) = default; // OK, returns x.i == y.i
  bool operator!=(const D& z) const = default;              // OK, returns (*this == z) ? false : true
};</code></pre>

<i> - end example]</i></ins></blockquote>

Remove all of 10.10.2 [class.spaceship] paragraph 1. Most of it was moved to 10.10.1, one sentence in it will be moved to the next paragraph:

> <del>The direct base class subobjects of C, in the order of their declaration in the base-specifier-list of C, followed
by the non-static data members of C, in the order of their declaration in the member-specification of C,
form a list of subobjects. In that list, any subobject of array type is recursively expanded to the sequence
of its elements, in the order of increasing subscript. Let xi be an lvalue denoting the i
th element in the
expanded list of subobjects for an object x (of length n), where xi
is formed by a sequence of derived-to-base
conversions (11.3.3.1), class member access expressions (7.6.1.5), and array subscript expressions (7.6.1.1)
applied to x. The type of the expression <code>x<sub>i</sub> <=> x<sub>i</sub></code>
is denoted by <code>R<sub>i</sub></code>. It is unspecified whether virtual base class subobjects are compared more than once.</del>

Add a new sentence to the start of 10.10.2 [class.spaceship] paragraph 2 (which will become paragraph 1):

> <ins>Given an expanded list of subobjects for an object `x` of type `C`, the type of the expression <code>x<sub>i</sub> <=> x<sub>i</sub></code>
is denoted by <code>R<sub>i</sub></code></ins>. If the declared return type of a defaulted three-way comparison operator function is `auto`, then the return type is deduced as the common comparison type (see below) of <code>R<sub>0</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>, . . . , R<sub>n−1</sub></code>. [...]

Rename clause "Other Comparison operators" [class.rel.eq] to "Relational Operators" [class.rel]. Remove the equality reference from 10.10.3 [class.rel.eq] paragraph 1:

> A defaulted relational (7.6.9) <del>or equality (7.6.10)</del> operator function for some operator @ shall have a declared
return type bool.

Change the example in [class.rel.eq] paragraph 3:

<blockquote><pre><code class="language-cpp">struct C {
  friend std::strong_equality operator<=>(const C&, const C&);
  </code><code><del>friend bool operator==(const C& x, const C& y) = default; // OK, returns x <=> y == 0</del></code><code class="language-cpp">
  bool operator<(const C&) = default;                       // OK, function is deleted
};</code></pre></blockquote>

Change 11.3.1.2 [over.match.oper] paragraph 3.4:

> - [...]
> - For the relational ([expr.rel]) <del>and equality ([expr.eq])</del> operators, the rewritten candidates include all member, non-member, and built-in candidates for the operator `<=>` for which the rewritten expression `(x <=> y) @ 0` is well-formed using that operator `<=>`. For the relational ([expr.rel])<del>, equality ([expr.eq]),</del> and three-way comparison ([expr.spaceship]) operators, the rewritten candidates also include a synthesized candidate, with the order of the two parameters reversed, for each member, non-member, and built-in candidate for the operator <=> for which the rewritten expression 0 @ (y <=> x) is well-formed using that operator<=>.  <ins>For the `!=` operator ([expr.eq]), the rewritten candidates include all member, non-member, and built-in candidates for the operator `==` for which the rewritten expression `(x == y)` is well-formed when contextually converted to `bool` using that operator `==`. For the equality operators, the rewritten candidates also include a synthesized candidate, with the order of the two parameters reversed, for each member, non-member, and built-in candidate for the operator `==` for which the rewritten expression `(y == x)` is well-formed when contextually converted to `bool` using that operator `==`.</ins> *[ Note:* A candidate synthesized from a member candidate has its implicit object parameter as the second parameter, thus implicit conversions are considered for the first, but not for the second, parameter. *—end note]* In each case, rewritten candidates are not considered in the context of the rewritten expression. For all other operators, the rewritten candidate set is empty.

Change 11.3.1.2 [over.match.oper] paragraph 8:

>  If a rewritten candidate is selected by overload resolution for <del>an</del> <ins>a relational or three-way comparison</ins> operator `@`, `x @ y` is interpreted as the rewritten expression: `0 @ (y <=> x)` if the selected candidate is a synthesized candidate with reversed order
of parameters, or `(x <=> y) @ 0` otherwise, using the selected rewritten `operator<=>` candidate. <ins>If a rewritten candidate is selected by overload resolution for a `!=` operator, `x != y` is interpreted as `(y == x) ? false : true` if the selected candidate is a synthesized candidate with reversed order of parameters, or `(x == y) ? false : true` otherwise, using the selected rewritten `operator==` candidate. If a rewritten candidate is selected by overload resolution for an `==` operator, `x == y` is interpreted as `(y == x) ? true : false` using the selected rewritten `operator==` candidate.</ins>

Change 12.1 [temp.param]/4:

> a type that is literal<del>,</del><ins> and</ins> has strong structural equality ([class.compare.default])<del>, has no mutable or volatile subobjects, and in which if there is a defaulted member <code>operator&lt;=&gt;</code>, then it is declared public,</del>

Change the example in 12.1 [temp.param]/p6 to default `==` instead of `<=>`.

<blockquote><pre><code>struct A { friend <del>auto operator&lt;=&gt;</del> <ins>bool operator==</ins>(const A&, const A&) = default; };</code></pre></blockquote>

Change the example in 12.3.2 [temp.arg.nontype]/p4 to default `==` instead of `<=>` (and additionally fix its arity):

<blockquote><pre><code><del>auto operator&lt;=&gt;(A, A)</del> <ins>bool operator==(const A&) const</ins> = default;</code></pre></blockquote>

Change 12.5 [temp.type] to refer to `==` instead of `<=>`:

> - their remaining corresponding non-type template-arguments have the same type and value after conversion to the type of the template-parameter, where they are considered to have the same value if they compare equal with <del><code>operator&lt;=&gt;</code></del> <ins><code>operator==</code></ins>, and
