# Revision History

R0 to R1: `safe_range` was renamed to `borrowed_range` in Prague by resolving
[@LWG3379]. This paper has been updated to reflect that.

# Introduction and Motivation

Consider the following approach to trimming a `std::string`:

```cpp
auto trim(std::string const& s) {
    auto isalpha = [](unsigned char c){ return std::isalpha(c); };
    auto b = ranges::find_if(s, isalpha);
    auto e = ranges::find_if(s | views::reverse, isalpha).base();
    return subrange(b, e);
}
```

This is a fairly nice and, importantly, safe way to implement `trim`. The
iterators `b` and `e` returned from `find_if` will not dangle, since they point
into the string `s` whose lifetime outlives the function.

Except this code will not compile at the moment, either in C++20 or in
range-v3, failing on the declaration of `e`. The algorithm `find_if` is in
[alg.find]{.sref} is declared as:

```cpp
template<input_range R, class Proj = identity,
         indirect_unary_predicate<projected<iterator_t<R>, Proj>> Pred>
  constexpr borrowed_iterator_t<R>
    ranges::find_if(R&& r, Pred pred, Proj proj = {});
```

`R` will deduce as `reverse_view<ref_view<std::string const>>`, which does
_not_ satisfy `borrowed_range` (it is neither an lvalue reference, nor does
`reverse_view` currently opt-in to being a `borrowed_range`) hence the
return type `borrowed_iterator_t<R>` is the type `dangling` rather than being the
type `iterator_t<R>`. Instead of getting the reverse iterator we might have
expected, that we need to call `.base()` on, we get effectively nothing. We
are forced to rewrite the above as:

```cpp
auto trim(std::string const& s) {
    auto isalpha = [](unsigned char c){ return std::isalpha(c); };
    auto b = ranges::find_if(s, isalpha);
    auto reversed = s | views::reverse;
    auto e = ranges::find_if(reversed, isalpha).base();
    return subrange(b, e);
}
```

Which is an unnecessary code indirection. The goal of this paper is to make the
initial example just work. We clearly have a borrowed range that is not marked
as such, so I consider this to be a library defect.

# History and Status Quo

Ranges introduced with it the concept _`forwarding-range`_. This was then
renamed to `safe_range` by [@P1870R1] in Belfast, and again to `borrowed_range`
by resolving [@LWG3379] in Prague, but the core concept remains
the same. A range is a `borrowed_range` when you can hold onto its iterators
after the range goes out of scope. There are two kinds of borrowed ranges:

- lvalue references to ranges are always borrowed ranges. It's not the lvalue reference
itself which owns the data, so if the reference dies, we're fine.
- ranges which must necessarily opt in to being considered borrowed, by way of the
new `enable_borrowed_range` variable template, which defaults to `false` for all
types.

There are several borrowed ranges which do this opt in today:

- `ref_view` is a borrowed range. It's basically a reference - the iterators it
gives out are iterators to the range it refers to, which it has no ownership of.
If the `ref_view` dies, the referred to range can still be around.
- `string_view` is a borrowed range. Like `ref_view`, it just refers to data - the
iterators it gives out are iterators into some other containers. `span` and
`subrange` are similar.
- `empty_view` doesn't even have any data, so it's trivially borrowed.
- `iota_view` works by having the iterators themselves own the "counter", so
having the iterators stick around is sufficient.

And that's it. We have six, _unconditionally_ borrowed ranges. All other ranges
and views in the standard library are _unconditionally_ not borrowed. But this is
far too strict. As the opening example demonstrates, there are many more kinds
of borrowed ranges you can construct than _just_ the chosen six.

This issue was first pointed out by Johel Ernesto Guerrero Pe√±a in [@stl2.640].

## Implementation Strategy

A range is going to be borrowed if its iterators do not in any way refer to it. For
the ranges in the working draft which are unconditionally borrowed, this follows
directly from how they actually work. But for some other ranges, it might
depend on implementation strategy.

One can imagine different specifications for views like `transform_view` and
even `filter_view` that might allow them to be borrowed, but that's beyond the scope
of this paper which is limited to those views that are already borrowed as specified.

# Proposal

Several range adapters semantically behave as if they have a single member of
some templated view type. If that underlying view type is a `borrowed_range`, the
range adapter itself can be transitively borrowed. For example, `s | views::reverse`
has the type `reverse_view<ref_view<string const>>`. This can be a `borrowed_range`
because `ref_view<string const>` is a `borrowed_range`. Likewise,
`s | views::reverse | views::take(3)` can also be a `borrowed_range` by extending
this logic further.

Here is a table of all the range adapters and factories in the current working
draft, what their current `borrowed_range` status is, and what this paper proposes.

<table>
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Current Status</th><th>Proposed</th></tr>
<tr><td>`empty`</td><td>Borrowed</td><td>No change</td></tr>
<tr><td>`single`</td><td>Not Borrowed</td><td>No change. It's the view which holds the element, not the iterators.</th></tr>
<tr><td>`iota`</td><td>Borrowed</td><td>No change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>`istream`</td><td>Not Borrowed</th><td>No change. The iterators need to refer to parent view, which holds onto the element.</td></tr>
<tr><td>`ref`</td><td>Borrowed</td><td>No change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>`filter`</td><td>Not Borrowed</th><td>No change. The view needs to own the predicate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>`transform`</td><td>Not Borrowed</th><td>No change, as above.</td></tr>
<tr><td>`take`</td><td>Not Borrowed</th><td>[Conditionally borrowed, based on the underlying view. The iterators are just iterators into the underlying view (or thin wrappers thereof).]{.addu}.</td></tr>
<tr><td>`take_while`</td><td>Not Borrowed</th><td>No change, same as `filter`.</td></tr>
<tr><td>`drop`</td><td>Not Borrowed</th><td>[Conditionally borrowed, same as `take`]{.addu}</td></tr>
<tr><td>`drop_while`</td><td>Not Borrowed</th><td>[Conditionally borrowed. Unlike `take_while` or `filter`, we only need the predicate to find the new begin. Once we found it, it's just transparent.]{.addu}</td></tr>
<tr><td>`join`</td><td>Not Borrowed</th><td>No change. This one is quite complex and iterators need to refer the `join_view`.</td></tr>
<tr><td>`split`</td><td>Not Borrowed</th><td>No change, as with `join`.</td></tr>
<tr><td>`counted`</td><td colspan="2">Not actually its own view, `counted(r, n)` is actually either some `subrange` or ill-formed, so it's already borrowed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>`common`</td><td>Not Borrowed</th><td>[Conditionally borrowed based on the underlying view. All it does is propagate iterators.]{.addu}</td></tr>
<tr><td>`reverse`</td><td>Not Borrowed</th><td>[Conditionally borrowed based on the underlying view. All it does is propagate reverse iterators.]{.addu}</td></tr>
<tr><td>`elements`/`keys`/`values`</td><td>Not Borrowed</th><td>[Conditionally borrowed based on the underlying view. This is a special case of `transform_view` where
the transform is actually encoded into the type, so it doesn't need to be
held onto by the view itself.]{.addu}</td></tr>

# Wording

Add six variable template specializations to [ranges.syn]{.sref}:

```diff
#include <initializer_list>
#include <iterator>

namespace std::ranges {
  // [...]


  // [range.take], take view
  template<view> class take_view;

+ template<class T>
+   inline constexpr bool enable_borrowed_range<take_view<T>> = enable_borrowed_range<T>;

  namespace views { inline constexpr @_unspecified_@ take = @_unspecified_@; }

  // [...]

  // [range.drop], drop view
  template<view V>
    class drop_view;

+ template<class T>
+   inline constexpr bool enable_borrowed_range<drop_view<T>> = enable_borrowed_range<T>;

  namespace views { inline constexpr @_unspecified_@ drop = @_unspecified_@; }

  // [range.drop.while], drop while view
  template<view V, class Pred>
    requires input_range<V> && is_object_v<Pred> &&
      indirect_unary_predicate<const Pred, iterator_t<V>>
    class drop_while_view;

+ template<class T, class Pred>
+   inline constexpr bool enable_borrowed_range<drop_while_view<T, Pred>> = enable_borrowed_range<T>;

  namespace views { inline constexpr @_unspecified_@ drop_while = @_unspecified_@; }

  // [...]

  // [range.common], common view
  template<view V>
    requires (!common_range<V> && copyable<iterator_t<V>>)
  class common_view;

+ template<class T>
+   inline constexpr bool enable_borrowed_range<common_view<T>> = enable_borrowed_range<T>;

  namespace views { inline constexpr @_unspecified_@ common = @_unspecified_@; }

  // [range.reverse], reverse view
  template<view V>
    requires bidirectional_range<V>
  class reverse_view;

+ template<class T>
+   inline constexpr bool enable_borrowed_range<reverse_view<T>> = enable_borrowed_range<T>;

  namespace views { inline constexpr @_unspecified_@ reverse = @_unspecified_@; }

  // [range.elements], elements view
  template<input_range V, size_t N>
    requires @_see below_@;
  class elements_view;

+ template<class T, size_t N>
+   inline constexpr bool enable_borrowed_range<elements_view<T, N>> = enable_borrowed_range<T>;

  template<class R>
    using keys_view = elements_view<all_view<R>, 0>;
  template<class R>
    using values_view = elements_view<all_view<R>, 1>;

  namespace views {
    template<size_t N>
      inline constexpr @_unspecified_@ elements = @_unspecified_@ ;
    inline constexpr @_unspecified_@ keys = @_unspecified_@ ;
    inline constexpr @_unspecified_@ values = @_unspecified_@ ;
  }
}
```

# Implementation

This has been implemented in range-v3 [@range-v3.1405]. The PR includes the six
range adapters in this paper, along with a smattering of other range adapters
from range-v3 that can also be made conditionally borrowed in this manner (`const`,
`chunk`, `delimit`, `drop_exactly`, `indirect`, `intersperse`, `move`, `slice`,
`sliding`, `tail`, `trim`, `unbounded`, and `zip`) as well as a bunch of other
range adapters that can be additionally made conditionally borrowed based on both
the underlying range and the shape of invocables that they rely on (`group_by`,
all the `set_algorithm_view` adapters, `split_when`, `take_while`/`iter_take_while`,
`transform`, and `zip_view`/`iter_zip_view`).
